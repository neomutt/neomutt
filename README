# This is the NeoMutt Project

## What is NeoMutt?

NeoMutt is a project of projects.

A place to gather all the patches against Mutt.

A place for all the developers to gather.  Especially those who have made
changes to Mutt, but haven't had those changes accepted.

Hopefully this will build the community and reduce duplicated effort.

## Credits

Richard Russon put a lot of work into creating NeoMutt: bringing together,
tidying up and fixing bugs.  However, without the original patch authors, there
would be nothing.

So, a BIG thanks to...

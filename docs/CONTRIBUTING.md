## Tips for a Good Bug Report

## AI Assistance Notice

If you are using any kind of AI assistance while contributing to NeoMutt, **this must be disclosed in the pull request**, along with the extent to which AI assistance was used (e.g., docs only vs. code generation). If PR responses are being generated by an AI, disclose that as well.

* Please provide a minimal working example. That means, you should try to
  replicate your issue with the minimal configuration from your NeoMutt config and/or
  any other relevant config files. These are the details you should be posting.

> This PR was written primarily by Claude Code.

* Please give us a list of versions of **all** programs relevant to
  your report.

> I consulted ChatGPT to understand the codebase but the solution was fully authored manually by myself.

Failure to disclose this is first and foremost rude to the human maintainers on the other end of the pull request, but it also makes it difficult to determine how much scrutiny to apply to the contribution.

## Tips for Writing a Good Feature Request

* Describe your problem and especially the context of it very detailed. It has
  happened many times that the problem could be solved without implementing
  another feature.

* Please describe also your desired solution carefully. Nothing is more
  frustrating—for both you and us, as developers—if we understand your
  problem the wrong way and implement something which doesn't help you.

## Reporting Bugs

We have a [bug report template](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md) that guides you through providing the necessary information. Please follow it when opening an issue to ensure we have all the details needed to help you.

## Tips for Writing Good Pull Requests

- Provide a minimal working example. Try to replicate your issue with the minimal configuration from your NeoMutt config and/or any other relevant config files.
- Be very careful when writing down the steps to reproduce your problem—sometimes even small details matter.
- Include a list of versions of **all** programs relevant to your report.
- Use Markdown syntax, especially for backtraces and config files.

## Feature Requests

We have a [feature request template](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md) that helps structure your proposal. Please follow it when opening a feature request.

* Your commits should be clear and concise. That means also you shouldn't sum up
  two features or two bug fixes into one commit. If you do, it makes both bug
  fixes or features harder to understand. Also, don't hesitate to
  [rewrite](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) the
  GitHub history of your development branch.

- Describe your problem and its context in detail. Often, the problem can be solved without implementing a new feature.
- Describe your desired solution carefully. Nothing is more frustrating, for both you and the developers, if we misunderstand your problem and implement something that doesn't help you.
- Make sure you don't fall into the trap of the [XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/).

* If your commit addresses a particular pull request (PR), commit, or issue, please say so in
  your commit. The GitHub documentation
  ([1](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls)
  and [2](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue))
  can help you with that.

* Please eliminate any warnings that `gcc` or any other tool produces during the
  compilation stage.

When submitting a pull request:

- The first line should be a short (50 characters or less) summary of your commit message. If you can't find a short enough one-line summary, split the commit into multiple ones.
- Keep one blank line between the one-line summary and the body.
- Use bullet points in the body of the commit message to separate multiple things you did.
- Keep your commits clear and concise. Avoid combining two features or bug fixes into one commit, as it makes them harder to understand. Don't hesitate to [rewrite](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) the Git history of your development branch.
- Wrap the body of the commit message at around 80 characters.
- If your commit addresses a particular pull request (PR), commit, or issue, please reference it. The GitHub documentation ([1](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls) and [2](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)) can help you with that.
- Eliminate any warnings that `gcc` or other tools produce during compilation.
- If your commit addresses only a specific method or file, mention it in your commit message.

The NeoMutt Team.

      <emphasis role="bold">NeoMutt</emphasis> is a small but very powerful
      text-based MIME mail client. NeoMutt is highly configurable, and is well
      suited to the mail power user with advanced features like key bindings,
      keyboard macros, mail threading, regular expression searches and
      a powerful pattern matching language for selecting groups of messages.

    <title>Getting Started</title>
    <para>
      This section is intended as a brief overview of how to use NeoMutt.
      There are many other features which are described elsewhere in the
      manual. There is even more information available in the NeoMutt FAQ and
      various web pages. See the
      <ulink url="https://neomutt.org">NeoMutt homepage</ulink> for more
      details.
    </para>
    <para>
      The keybindings described in this section are the defaults as
      distributed. Your local system administrator may have altered the
      defaults for your site. You can always type <quote>?</quote> in any menu
      to display the current bindings.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first thing you need to do is invoke NeoMutt, simply by typing
      <literal>neomutt</literal> at the command line. There are various
      command-line options, see either the NeoMutt man page or the
      <link linkend="commandline">reference</link>.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="core-concepts">
      <title>Core Concepts</title>
      <para>
        NeoMutt is a text-based application which interacts with users through
        different menus which are mostly line-/entry-based or page-based.
        A line-based menu is the so-called <quote>index</quote> menu (listing
        all messages of the currently opened folder) or the
        <quote>alias</quote> menu (allowing you to select recipients from
        a list). Examples for page-based menus are the <quote>pager</quote>
        (showing one message at a time) or the <quote>help</quote> menu listing
        all available key bindings.
      </para>
      <para>
        The user interface consists of a context sensitive help line at the
        top, the menu's contents followed by a context sensitive status line
        and finally the command line. The command line is used to display
        informational and error messages as well as for prompts and for
        entering interactive commands.
      </para>
      <para>
        NeoMutt is configured through variables which, if the user wants to
        permanently use a non-default value, are written to configuration
        files. NeoMutt supports a rich config file syntax to make even complex
        configuration files readable and commentable.
      </para>
      <para>
        Because NeoMutt allows for customizing almost all key bindings, there
        are so-called <quote>functions</quote> which can be executed manually
        (using the command line) or in macros. Macros allow the user to bind
        a sequence of commands to a single key or a short key sequence instead
        of repeating a sequence of actions over and over.
      </para>
      <para>
        Many commands (such as saving or copying a message to another folder)
        can be applied to a single message or a set of messages (so-called
        <quote>tagged</quote> messages). To help selecting messages, NeoMutt
        provides a rich set of message patterns (such as recipients, sender,
        body contents, date sent/received, etc.) which can be combined into
        complex expressions using the boolean <emphasis>and</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>or</emphasis> operations as well as negating. These patterns
        can also be used to (for example) search for messages or to limit the
        index to show only matching messages.
      </para>
      <para>
        NeoMutt supports a <quote>hook</quote> concept which allows the user to
        execute arbitrary configuration commands and functions in certain
        situations such as entering a folder, starting a new message or
        replying to an existing one. These hooks can be used to highly
        customize NeoMutt's behavior including managing multiple identities,
        customizing the display for a folder or even implementing
        auto-archiving based on a per-folder basis and much more.
      </para>
      <para>
        Besides an interactive mode, NeoMutt can also be used as a command-line
        tool to send messages. See
        <xref linkend="tab-commandline-options" /> for a complete list of
        command-line options.

      <title>Screens and Menus</title>

      <sect2 id="intro-index">
        <title>Index</title>
        <para>
          The index is the screen that you usually see first when you start
          NeoMutt. It gives an overview over your emails in the currently
          opened mailbox. By default, this is your system mailbox. The
          information you see in the index is a list of emails, each with its
          number on the left, its flags (new email, important email, email that
          has been forwarded or replied to, tagged email, ...), the date when
          email was sent, its sender, the email size, and the subject.
          Additionally, the index also shows thread hierarchies: when you reply
          to an email, and the other person replies back, you can see the other
          person's email in a "sub-tree" below. This is especially useful for
          personal email between a group of people or when you've subscribed to
          mailing lists.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="intro-pager">
        <title>Pager</title>
        <para>
          The pager is responsible for showing the email content. On the top of
          the pager you have an overview over the most important email headers
          like the sender, the recipient, the subject, and much more
          information. How much information you actually see depends on your
          configuration, which we'll describe below.
        </para>
        <para>
          Below the headers, you see the email body which usually contains the
          message. If the email contains any attachments, you will see more
          information about them below the email body, or, if the attachments
          are text files, you can view them directly in the pager.
        </para>
        <para>
          To give the user a good overview, it is possible to configure NeoMutt
          to show different things in the pager with different colors.
          Virtually everything that can be described with a regular expression
          can be colored, e.g. URLs, email addresses or smileys.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="intro-browser">
        <title>File Browser</title>
        <para>
          The file browser is the interface to the local or remote file system.
          When selecting a mailbox to open, the browser allows custom sorting
          of items, limiting the items shown by a regular expression and
          a freely adjustable format of what to display in which way. It also
          allows for easy navigation through the file system when selecting
          file(s) to attach to a message, select multiple files to attach and
          many more.
        </para>
        <para>
          Some mail systems can nest mail folders inside other mail folders.
          The normal open entry commands in NeoMutt will open the mail folder and
          you can't see the sub-folders.  If you instead use the
          <literal>&lt;descend-directory&gt;</literal> function it will go into
          the directory and not open it as a mail directory.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="intro-sidebar">
        <title>Sidebar</title>
        <para>
          The Sidebar shows a list of all your mailboxes. The list can be
          turned on and off, it can be themed and the list style can be
          configured.
        </para>
        <para>
          This part of the manual is suitable for beginners. If you already
          know NeoMutt you could skip ahead to the main
          <link linkend="sidebar">Sidebar guide</link>. If you just want to get
          started, you could use the sample

        </para>
        <para>
          To check if NeoMutt supports <quote>Sidebar</quote>, look for the
          string <literal>+sidebar</literal> in the neomutt version.

            <para>
              The most important variable is
              <literal>$sidebar_visible</literal>. You can set this in your
              <quote>neomuttrc</quote>, or bind a key to the function
              <literal>&lt;sidebar-toggle-visible&gt;</literal>.
            </para>

<screen>
set sidebar_visible                         <emphasis role="comment"># Make the Sidebar visible by default</emphasis>
bind index,pager B sidebar-toggle-visible   <emphasis role="comment"># Use 'B' to switch the Sidebar on and off</emphasis>
</screen>

            <para>
              Next, decide how wide you want the Sidebar to be. 25 characters
              might be enough for the mailbox name and some numbers. Remember,
              you can hide/show the Sidebar at the press of button.
            </para>
            <para>
              Finally, you might want to change the divider character. By
              default, Sidebar draws an ASCII line between it and the Index
              panel If your terminal supports it, you can use a Unicode
              line-drawing character.
            </para>

<screen>
set sidebar_width = 25                  <emphasis role="comment"># Plenty of space</emphasis>
set sidebar_divider_char = '│'          <emphasis role="comment"># Pretty line-drawing character</emphasis>

        <title>Help</title>
        <para>
          The help screen is meant to offer a quick help to the user. It lists
          the current configuration of key bindings and their associated
          commands including a short description, and currently unbound
          functions that still need to be associated with a key binding (or
          alternatively, they can be called via the NeoMutt command prompt).

      <sect2 id="intro-compose">
        <title>Compose Menu</title>
        <para>
          The compose menu features a split screen containing the information
          which really matter before actually sending a message by mail: who
          gets the message as what (recipients and who gets what kind of copy).
          Additionally, users may set security options like deciding whether to
          sign, encrypt or sign and encrypt a message with/for what keys. Also,
          it's used to attach messages, to re-edit any attachment including the
          message itself.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="intro-alias">
        <title>Alias Menu</title>
        <para>
          The alias menu is used to help users finding the recipients of
          messages. For users who need to contact many people, there's no need
          to remember addresses or names completely because it allows for
          searching, too. The alias mechanism and thus the alias menu also
          features grouping several addresses by a shorter nickname, the actual
          alias, so that users don't have to select each single recipient
          manually.

      <sect2 id="intro-attach">
        <title>Attachment Menu</title>
        <para>
          As will be later discussed in detail, NeoMutt features a good and
          stable MIME implementation, that is, it supports sending and
          receiving messages of arbitrary MIME types. The attachment menu
          displays a message's structure in detail: what content parts are
          attached to which parent part (which gives a true tree structure),
          which type is of what type and what size. Single parts may saved,
          deleted or modified to offer great and easy access to message's
          internals.

          NeoMutt maintains a history for the built-in editor. The number of

          using <link linkend="history-file">$history_file</link> and
          <link linkend="save-history">$save_history</link>. You may cycle through

          <literal>&lt;history-up&gt;</literal> and/or
          <literal>&lt;history-down&gt;</literal> commands. NeoMutt will

          NeoMutt automatically filters out consecutively repeated items from

          <link linkend="history-remove-dups">$history_remove_dups</link> is
          set, all repeated items are removed from the history. It also mimics
          the behavior of some shells by ignoring items starting with a space.
          The latter feature can be useful in macros to not clobber the
          history's valuable entries with unwanted entries.

          number. Zero or more of the <quote>flags</quote> in

          By default, NeoMutt uses its built-in pager to display the contents
          of messages (an external pager such as <literal>less(1)</literal> can
          be configured, see <link linkend="pager">$pager</link> variable). The
          pager is very similar to the Unix program <literal>less(1)</literal>
          though not nearly as featureful.

        <para>
          In addition to key bindings in <xref linkend="tab-key-pager" />, many
          of the functions from the index menu are also available in the pager,
          such as <literal>&lt;delete-message&gt;</literal> or
          <literal>&lt;copy-message&gt;</literal> (this is one advantage over
          using an external pager to view messages).
        </para>
        <para>
          Also, the internal pager supports a couple other advanced features.
          For one, it will accept and translate the <quote>standard</quote>
          nroff sequences for bold and underline. These sequences are a series
          of either the letter, backspace (<quote>^H</quote>), the letter
          again for bold or the letter, backspace, <quote>_</quote> for
          denoting underline. NeoMutt will attempt to display these in bold and
          underline respectively if your terminal supports them. If not, you
          can use the bold and underline <link linkend="color">color</link>
          objects to specify a <command>color</command> or mono attribute for
          them.
        </para>
        <para>
          Additionally, the internal pager supports the ANSI escape sequences
          for character attributes. NeoMutt translates them into the correct
          color and character settings. The sequences NeoMutt supports are:
        </para>

<screen>
\e[ Ps; Ps; ...  Ps;m
</screen>

        <para>
          where <emphasis>Ps</emphasis> can be one of the codes shown in

          Collapsing a thread displays only the first message in the thread and
          hides the others. This is useful when threads contain so many
          messages that you can only see a handful of threads on the screen.
          See %M in <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>. For
          example, you could use <quote>%?M?(#%03M)&amp;(%4l)?</quote> in
          <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> to optionally display
          the number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed. The
          <literal>%?&lt;char&gt;?&lt;if-part&gt;&amp;&lt;else-part&gt;?</literal>
          syntax is explained in detail in

          Technically, every reply should contain a list of its parent messages

          <link linkend="strict-threads">$strict_threads</link> variable.

                content type to fix, for instance, bogus character set
                parameters. When invoked from the index or from the pager,
                you'll have the opportunity to edit the top-level attachment's
                content type. On the
                <link linkend="attach-menu">attachment menu</link>, you can
                change any attachment's content type. These changes are not

                NeoMutt takes the current message as a template for a new
                message. This function is best described as "recall from
                arbitrary folders". It can conveniently be used to forward MIME
                messages while preserving the original mail structure. Note
                that the amount of headers included here depends on the value
                of the <link linkend="weed">$weed</link> variable.

          If you have told NeoMutt to PGP or S/MIME encrypt a message, it will
          guide you through a key selection process when you try to send the
          message. NeoMutt will not ask you any questions about keys which have
          a certified user ID matching one of the message recipients' mail
          addresses. However, there may be situations in which there are
          several keys, weakly certified user ID fields, or where no matching
          keys can be found.
        </para>
        <para>
          In these cases, you are dropped into a menu with a list of keys from
          which you can select one. When you quit this menu, or NeoMutt can't
          find any matching keys, you are prompted for a user ID. You can, as
          usually, abort this prompt using <literal>^G</literal>. When you do
          so, NeoMutt will return to the compose screen.

          The capabilities field (<quote>%c</quote>) expands to
          a two-character sequence representing a key's capabilities. The first
          character gives the key's encryption capabilities: A minus sign
          (<quote>-</quote>) means that the key cannot be used for encryption.
          A dot (<quote>.</quote>) means that it's marked as a signature key
          in one of the user IDs, but may also be used for encryption. The
          letter <quote>e</quote> indicates that this key can be used for
          encryption.
        </para>
        <para>
          The second character indicates the key's signing capabilities. Once
          again, a <quote>-</quote> implies <quote>not for signing</quote>,
          <quote>.</quote> implies that the key is marked as an encryption key
          in one of the user-ids, and <quote>s</quote> denotes a key which can
          be used for signing.
        </para>
        <para>
          Finally, the validity field (<quote>%t</quote>) indicates how
          well-certified a user-id is. A question mark (<quote>?</quote>)
          indicates undefined validity, a minus character (<quote>-</quote>)
          marks an untrusted association, a space character means a partially
          trusted association, and a plus character (<quote>+</quote>)
          indicates complete validity.

              NeoMutt only supports space-stuffing for the first two types of
              lines but not for the third: It is impossible to safely detect
              whether a leading <literal>&gt;</literal> character starts a quote
              or not.

      <title>Forwarding and Bouncing Mail</title>
      <para>
        Bouncing and forwarding let you send an existing message to recipients
        that you specify. Bouncing a message sends a verbatim copy of a message
        to alternative addresses as if they were the message's original
        recipients specified in the Bcc header. Forwarding a message, on the
        other hand, allows you to modify the message before it is resent (for
        example, by adding your own comments). Bouncing is done using the
        <literal>&lt;bounce&gt;</literal> function and forwarding using the
        <literal>&lt;forward&gt;</literal> function bound to <quote>b</quote>
        and <quote>f</quote> respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
        Forwarding can be done by including the original message in the new
        message's body (surrounded by indicating lines) or including it as
        a MIME attachment, depending on the value of the
        <link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> variable. Decoding of
        attachments, like in the pager, can be controlled by the
        <link linkend="forward-decode">$forward_decode</link> and
        <link linkend="mime-forward-decode">$mime_forward_decode</link>
        variables, respectively. The desired forwarding format may depend on
        the content, therefore
        <link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is a quadoption
        which, for example, can be set to <quote>ask-no</quote>.
      </para>
      <para>
        NeoMutt's default (<link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link>=<quote>no</quote> and
        <link linkend="forward-decode">$forward_decode</link>=<quote>yes</quote>) is
        to use standard inline forwarding.  In that mode all text-decodable
        parts are included in the new message body.  Other attachments from
        the original email can also be attached to the new message, based on the
        quadoption <link linkend="forward-attachments">$forward_attachments</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The inclusion of headers is controlled by the current setting of the
        <link linkend="weed">$weed</link> variable, unless
        <link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is set.
      </para>
      <para>
        By default a forwarded message does not reference the messages it
        contains. When
        <link linkend="forward-references">$forward_references</link> is set,
        a forwarded message includes the <quote>In-Reply-To:</quote> and
        <quote>References:</quote> headers, just like a reply would. Hence the
        forwarded message becomes part of the original thread instead of
        starting a new one.
      </para>
      <para>
        Editing the message to forward follows the same procedure as sending or
        replying to a message does, but can be disabled via the quadoption
        <link linkend="forward-edit">$forward_edit</link>.

      <title>Postponing Mail</title>
      <para>
        At times it is desirable to delay sending a message that you have
        already begun to compose. When the
        <literal>&lt;postpone-message&gt;</literal> function is used in the
        <emphasis>compose</emphasis> menu, the body of your message and
        attachments are stored in the mailbox specified by the
        <link linkend="postponed">$postponed</link> variable. This means that
        you can recall the message even if you exit NeoMutt and then restart it
        at a later time.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once a message is postponed, there are several ways to resume it. From
        the command line you can use the <quote>-p</quote> option, or if you
        compose a new message from the <emphasis>index</emphasis> or
        <emphasis>pager</emphasis> you will be prompted if postponed messages
        exist. If multiple messages are currently postponed, the
        <emphasis>postponed</emphasis> menu will pop up and you can select
        which message you would like to resume.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          If you postpone a reply to a message, the reply setting of the
          message is only updated when you actually finish the message and send
          it. Also, you must be in the same folder with the message you replied
          to for the status of the message to be updated.

        Debug messages are not shown by default. To enable them NeoMutt must be

        <link linkend="tab-commandline-options"><literal>-d</literal> command line parameter</link>
        at startup. The <literal>-d</literal> parameter expects a debug level
        which can range from 1 to 5 and affects verbosity of the debug
        messages. A value of 2 is recommended for the start. If debug logging
        is enabled, all log messages (i.e. errors, warnings, ..., debug) are
        additionally written to the file <literal>~/.neomuttdebug0</literal>.

        library.

          The majority of NeoMutt's config will be read from two files: the

          The last file that gets read will overwrite any settings from

        to be customized to your needs and preferences.  However, this
        configurability can make it difficult when just getting started.  A few

        An initialization file consists of a series of
        <link linkend="commands">commands</link>. Each line of the file may
        contain one or more commands. When multiple commands are used, they

        The hash mark, or pound sign (<quote>#</quote>), is used as

        Single quotes (<quote>'</quote>) and double quotes (<quote>"</quote>)
        can be used to quote strings which contain spaces or other special
        characters. The difference between the two types of quotes is similar
        to that of many popular shell programs, namely that a single quote is
        used to specify a literal string (one that is not interpreted for shell
        variables or quoting with a backslash [see next paragraph]), while
        double quotes indicate a string for which should be evaluated. For
        example, backticks are evaluated inside of double quotes, but
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> for single quotes.
      </para>
      <para>
        <quote>\</quote> quotes the next character, just as in shells such as
        bash and zsh. For example, if want to put quotes <quote>"</quote>
        inside of a string, you can use <quote>\</quote> to force the next
        character to be a literal instead of interpreted character.

        It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix command in an
        initialization file. This is accomplished by enclosing the command in
        backticks (``). In <xref linkend="ex-rc-backtick" />, the output of the
        Unix command <quote>uname -a</quote> will be substituted before the
        line is parsed. Since initialization files are line oriented, only the
        first line of output from the Unix command will be substituted.

        To avoid the output of backticks being parsed, place them inside double
        quotes.  In <xref linkend="ex-backtick-dblquotes"/>, the output of the
        gpg decryption is assigned directly to $imap_pass, so that special

        <quote>$</quote>) are not parsed and interpreted specially by neomutt.

        will cause NeoMutt to save outgoing messages to a folder named

        NeoMutt expands the variable when it is assigned, not when it is used.

        All configuration files are expected to be in the current locale as

        startup. If a configuration file is not encoded in the same character
        set the <link linkend="config-charset">$config_charset</link> variable
        should be used: all lines starting with the next are recoded from

            If <link linkend="config-charset">$config_charset</link> is set, it

      <para>
        NeoMutt supports grouping addresses logically into named groups. An
        address or address pattern can appear in several groups at the same
        time. These groups can be used in
        <link linkend="patterns">patterns</link> (for searching, limiting and
        tagging) and in hooks by using group patterns. This can be useful to
        classify mail and take certain actions depending on in what groups the
        message is. For example, the NeoMutt user's mailing list would fit into
        the categories <quote>mailing list</quote> and
        <quote>NeoMutt-related</quote>. Using
        <link linkend="send-hook"><literal>send-hook</literal></link>, the
        sender can be set to a dedicated one for writing mailing list messages,
        and the signature could be set to a NeoMutt-related one for writing to
        a NeoMutt list – for other lists, the list sender setting still applies
        but a different signature can be selected. Or, given a group only
        containing recipients known to accept encrypted mail,
        <quote>auto-encryption</quote> can be achieved easily.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <command>group</command> command is used to directly add either
        addresses or regular expressions to the specified group or groups. The
        different categories of arguments to the <command>group</command>
        command can be in any order. The flags <literal>-rx</literal> and
        <literal>-addr</literal> specify what the following strings (that
        cannot begin with a hyphen) should be interpreted as: either a regular
        expression or an email address, respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
        These address groups can also be created implicitly by the
        <link linkend="alias"><command>alias</command></link>,
        <link linkend="lists"><command>lists</command></link>,
        <link linkend="lists"><command>subscribe</command></link> and
        <link linkend="alternates"><command>alternates</command></link>
        commands by specifying the optional <literal>-group</literal> option.
        For example,
      </para>

<screen>
alternates -group me address1 address2
alternates -group me -group work address3
</screen>

      <para>
        would create a group named <quote>me</quote> which contains all your
        addresses and a group named <quote>work</quote> which contains only
        your work address <emphasis>address3</emphasis>. Besides many other
        possibilities, this could be used to automatically mark your own
        messages in a mailing list folder as read or use a special signature
        for work-related messages.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <command>ungroup</command> command is used to remove addresses or
        regular expressions from the specified group or groups. The syntax is
        similar to the <command>group</command> command, however the special
        character <literal>*</literal> can be used to empty a group of all of
        its contents. As soon as a group gets empty because all addresses and
        regular expressions have been removed, it'll internally be removed, too
        (i.e. there cannot be an empty group). When removing regular
        expressions from a group, the pattern must be specified exactly as
        given to the <command>group</command> command or
        <literal>-group</literal> argument.

      <para>
        Unlike other mailers, NeoMutt doesn't require aliases to be defined in
        a special file. The <command>alias</command> command can appear
        anywhere in a configuration file, as long as this file is
        <link linkend="source"><command>sourced</command></link>. Consequently,
        you can have multiple alias files, or you can have all aliases defined
        in your <literal>.neomuttrc</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        On the other hand, the
        <link linkend="create-alias"><literal>&lt;create-alias&gt;</literal></link>
        function can use only one file, the one pointed to by the
        <link linkend="alias-file">$alias_file</link> variable (which is
        <literal>~/.neomuttrc</literal> by default). This file is not special
        either, in the sense that NeoMutt will happily append aliases to any
        file, but in order for the new aliases to take effect you need to
        explicitly <link linkend="source"><command>source</command></link> this
        file too.

source ~/.mail_aliases

      </example>
      <para>
        To use aliases, you merely use the alias at any place in NeoMutt where
        NeoMutt prompts for addresses, such as the <emphasis>To:</emphasis> or
        <emphasis>Cc:</emphasis> prompt. You can also enter aliases in your
        editor at the appropriate headers if you have the
        <link linkend="edit-headers">$edit_headers</link> variable set.
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition, at the various address prompts, you can use the tab
        character to expand a partial alias to the full alias. If there are
        multiple matches, NeoMutt will bring up a menu with the matching
        aliases. In order to be presented with the full list of aliases, you
        must hit tab without a partial alias, such as at the beginning of the
        prompt or after a comma denoting multiple addresses.
      </para>
      <para>
        In the alias menu, you can select as many aliases as you want with the
        <literal>select-entry</literal> key (default: &lt;Return&gt;), and use
        the <emphasis>exit</emphasis> key (default: q) to return to the address
        prompt.

              use in this menu. This allows you to bind a key to a certain

        <emphasis>key</emphasis> is the key (or key sequence) you wish to bind.
        To specify a control character, use the sequence

      <para>
        It is often desirable to change settings based on which mailbox you are
        reading. The <command>folder-hook</command> command provides a method
        by which you can execute any configuration command.
        <emphasis>regex</emphasis> is a regular expression specifying in which
        mailboxes to execute <emphasis>command</emphasis> before loading. If
        a mailbox matches multiple <command>folder-hook</command>s, they are
        executed in the order given in the <literal>.neomuttrc</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The regex parameter has
        <link linkend="shortcuts">mailbox shortcut</link> expansion performed
        on the first character. See <xref linkend="mailbox-hook" /> for more
        details.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          If you use the <quote>!</quote> shortcut for
          <link linkend="spoolfile">$spoolfile</link> at the beginning of the
          pattern, you must place it inside of double or single quotes in order
          to distinguish it from the logical <emphasis>not</emphasis> operator
          for the expression.
        </para>
      </note>
      <note>
        <para>
          Settings are <emphasis>not</emphasis> restored when you leave the
          mailbox. For example, a command action to perform is to change the
          sorting method based upon the mailbox being read:
        </para>
        <screen>folder-hook work "set sort=threads"</screen>
        <para>
          However, the sorting method is not restored to its previous value
          when reading a different mailbox. To specify
          a <emphasis>default</emphasis> command, use the pattern
          <quote>.</quote> before other <command>folder-hook</command>s
          adjusting a value on a per-folder basis because
          <command>folder-hook</command>s are evaluated in the order given in
          the configuration file.

          in reverse order.

      <para>
        Macros are useful when you would like a single key to perform a series
        of actions. When you press <emphasis>key</emphasis> in menu
        <emphasis>menu</emphasis>, NeoMutt will behave as if you had typed
        <emphasis>sequence</emphasis>. So if you have a common sequence of
        commands you type, you can create a macro to execute those commands
        with a single key or fewer keys.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>menu</emphasis> is the <link linkend="maps">map</link> which
        the macro will be bound in. Multiple maps may be specified by
        separating multiple menu arguments by commas. Whitespace may not be
        used in between the menu arguments and the commas separating them.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>key</emphasis> and <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> are expanded
        by the same rules as the <link linkend="bind">key bindings</link> with
        some additions. The first is that control characters in
        <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> can also be specified as
        <emphasis>^x</emphasis>. In order to get a caret (<quote>^</quote>)
        you need to use <emphasis>^^</emphasis>. Secondly, to specify a certain
        key such as <emphasis>up</emphasis> or to invoke a function directly,
        you can use the format <emphasis>&lt;key name&gt;</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>&lt;function name&gt;</emphasis>. For a listing of key names
        see the section on <link linkend="bind">key bindings</link>. Functions
        are listed in the <link linkend="functions">reference</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The advantage with using function names directly is that the macros
        will work regardless of the current key bindings, so they are not
        dependent on the user having particular key definitions. This makes
        them more robust and portable, and also facilitates defining of macros
        in files used by more than one user (e.g., the system neomuttrc).
      </para>
      <para>
        Optionally you can specify a descriptive text after
        <emphasis>sequence</emphasis>, which is shown in the help screens if
        they contain a description.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          Macro definitions (if any) listed in the help screen(s), are silently
          truncated at the screen width, and are not wrapped.
        </para>

        <para>
          Missing key sequence in unmacro command means unmacro all macros in menus
          given in <emphasis>menu</emphasis>.

        <para>
          Some objects in NeoMutt support <emphasis>lists</emphasis> of color
          rules.  Each rule has a pattern and a color.
          Each is checked in turn
          and any matching rules are applied cumulatively (overlaid).
        </para>
        <para>
          When applying the colours, each pattern will be tested against the
          field to be colored.  All of the matching patterns will have their
          colors applied in the order they are configured.
        </para>
        <para>
          The color lists work in slightly different ways to each other.

          <literal>header</literal> match a <emphasis>regular expression</emphasis>
          (regex) in the header/body of a email.
        </para>
        <para>
          <literal>index</literal> objects match a <emphasis>pattern</emphasis>
          in the email index (see <xref linkend="patterns" />)
          Note that IMAP server-side searches (=b, =B, =h) are not
          supported for color index patterns.

        <para>
          When <link linkend="header-color-partial">$header_color_partial</link>
          is unset (the default), a <literal>header</literal> matched by
          <emphasis>regex</emphasis> will have color applied to the entire

          <emphasis>regex</emphasis>.

        <para>
          For the <literal>status</literal> list, the
          <emphasis>regular expression</emphasis> is optional.  Without one,
          the command will set the default style for the status bar.  With a
          regex (and an optional number), it's possible to style parts of the
          status bar.  See: <link linkend="status-color">Status-Color feature</link>
          for more detail.
        </para>

          Color lists can be undone by using the <literal>uncolor</literal>

          precise rules about where to break and how, NeoMutt always folds

          folding.)

        <para>
          Messages often have many header fields added by automatic processing
          systems, or which may not seem useful to display on the screen. This
          command allows you to specify header fields which you don't normally
          want to see in the pager.
        </para>
        <para>
          You do not need to specify the full header field name. For example,
          <quote>ignore content-</quote> will ignore all header fields that
          begin with the pattern <quote>content-</quote>.
          <quote>ignore&#160;*</quote> will ignore all headers.
        </para>
        <para>
          To remove a previously added token from the list, use the
          <quote>unignore</quote> command. The <quote>unignore</quote> command
          will make NeoMutt display headers with the given pattern. For
          example, if you do <quote>ignore x-</quote> it is possible to
          <quote>unignore x-mailer</quote>.
        </para>
        <para>
          <quote>unignore&#160;*</quote> will remove all tokens from the ignore

      <para>
        With various functions, NeoMutt will treat messages differently,
        depending on whether you sent them or whether you received them from
        someone else. For instance, when replying to a message that you sent to
        a different party, NeoMutt will automatically suggest to send the
        response to the original message's recipients – responding to yourself
        won't make much sense in many cases. (See
        <link linkend="reply-to">$reply_to</link>.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Many users receive e-mail under a number of different addresses. To
        fully use NeoMutt's features here, the program must be able to
        recognize what e-mail addresses you receive mail under. That's the
        purpose of the <command>alternates</command> command: It takes a list
        of regular expressions, each of which can identify an address under
        which you receive e-mail.
      </para>
      <para>
        As addresses are matched using regular expressions and not exact strict
        comparisons, you should make sure you specify your addresses as precise
        as possible to avoid mismatches. For example, if you specify:
      </para>
      <screen>alternates user@example</screen>
      <para>
        NeoMutt will consider
        <quote><literal>some-user@example</literal></quote> as being your
        address, too which may not be desired. As a solution, in such cases
        addresses should be specified as:
      </para>
      <screen>alternates '^user@example$'</screen>
      <para>
        The <literal>-group</literal> flag causes all of the subsequent regular
        expressions to be added to the named group.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <command>unalternates</command> command can be used to write
        exceptions to <command>alternates</command> patterns. If an address
        matches something in an <command>alternates</command> command, but you
        nonetheless do not think it is from you, you can list a more precise
        pattern under an <command>unalternates</command> command.
      </para>
      <para>
        To remove a regular expression from the <command>alternates</command>
        list, use the <command>unalternates</command> command with exactly the
        same <emphasis>regex</emphasis>. Likewise, if the
        <emphasis>regex</emphasis> for an <command>alternates</command> command
        matches an entry on the <command>unalternates</command> list, that
        <command>unalternates</command> entry will be removed. If the
        <emphasis>regex</emphasis> for <command>unalternates</command> is
        <quote>*</quote>, <emphasis>all entries</emphasis> on
        <command>alternates</command> will be removed.

      <para>
        NeoMutt has a few nice features for
        <link linkend="using-lists">handling mailing lists</link>. In order to
        take advantage of them, you must specify which addresses belong to
        mailing lists, and which mailing lists you are subscribed to. NeoMutt
        also has limited support for auto-detecting mailing lists: it supports
        parsing <literal>mailto:</literal> links in the common
        <literal>List-Post:</literal> header which has the same effect as
        specifying the list address via the <command>lists</command> command
        (except the group feature). Once you have done this, the
        <link linkend="list-reply"><literal>&lt;list-reply&gt;</literal></link>
        function will work for all known lists. Additionally, when you send a
        message to a known list and <link linkend="followup-to">$followup_to</link>
        is set, NeoMutt will add a Mail-Followup-To header.  For unsubscribed
        lists, this will include your personal address, ensuring you receive a
        copy of replies.  For subscribed mailing lists, the header will not,
        telling other users' mail user agents not to send copies of replies to
        your personal address.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          The Mail-Followup-To header is a non-standard extension which is not
          supported by all mail user agents. Adding it is not bullet-proof
          against receiving personal CCs of list messages. Also note that the
          generation of the Mail-Followup-To header is controlled by the
          <link linkend="followup-to">$followup_to</link> configuration
          variable since it's common practice on some mailing lists to send Cc
          upon replies (which is more a group- than a list-reply).
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        More precisely, NeoMutt maintains lists of patterns for the addresses
        of known and subscribed mailing lists. Every subscribed mailing list is
        known. To mark a mailing list as known, use the <command>list</command>
        command. To mark it as subscribed, use <command>subscribe</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use regular expressions with both commands. To mark all
        messages sent to a specific bug report's address on Debian's bug
        tracking system as list mail, for instance, you could say
      </para>
      <screen>subscribe [0-9]+.*@bugs.debian.org</screen>
      <para>
        as it's often sufficient to just give a portion of the list's e-mail
        address.
      </para>
      <para>
        Specify as much of the address as you need to to remove ambiguity. For
        example, if you've subscribed to the NeoMutt mailing list, you will
        receive mail addressed to <literal>neomutt-users@neomutt.org</literal>.
        So, to tell NeoMutt that this is a mailing list, you could add
        <literal>lists neomutt-users@</literal> to your initialization file. To
        tell NeoMutt that you are subscribed to it, add
        <literal><command>subscribe</command> neomutt-users</literal> to your
        initialization file instead. If you also happen to get mail from
        someone whose address is <literal>neomutt-users@example.com</literal>,
        you could use
        <literal><command>lists</command> ^neomutt-users@neomutt\\.org$</literal>
        or
        <literal><command>subscribe</command> ^neomutt-users@neomutt\\.org$</literal>
        to match only mail from the actual list.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <literal>-group</literal> flag adds all of the subsequent regular
        expressions to the named <link linkend="addrgroup">address group</link>
        in addition to adding to the specified address list.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <quote>unlists</quote> command is used to remove a token from the
        list of known and subscribed mailing-lists. Use
        <quote>unlists&#160;*</quote> to remove all tokens.
      </para>
      <para>
        To remove a mailing list from the list of subscribed mailing lists, but

          affects these characters (like <link linkend="folder">$folder</link>
          and <link linkend="spoolfile">$spoolfile</link>) should be set before
          the <command>mailboxes</command> command. If none of these shortcuts
          are used, a local path should be absolute as otherwise NeoMutt tries

      <para>
        The <command>my_hdr</command> command allows you to create your own
        header fields which will be added to every message you send and appear
        in the editor if <link linkend="edit-headers">$edit_headers</link> is
        set.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, if you would like to add an <quote>Organization:</quote>
        header field to all of your outgoing messages, you can put the command
        something like shown in <xref linkend="ex-my-hdr" /> in your

          NeoMutt enforces the rule.
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        If you would like to add a header field to a single message, you should
        either set the <link linkend="edit-headers">$edit_headers</link>
        variable, or use the <literal>&lt;edit-headers&gt;</literal> function
        (default: <quote>E</quote>) in the compose menu so that you can edit
        the header of your message along with the body.

      <para>
        To remove user defined header fields, use the
        <command>unmy_hdr</command> command. You may specify an asterisk
        (<quote>*</quote>) to remove all header fields, or the fields to

        <command>send2-hook</command> is matched every time a message is

      <para>
        For each type of <command>send-hook</command> or

          <command>send-hook</command>'s are only executed once after getting the

        When encrypting messages with PGP/GnuPG or OpenSSL, you may want to
        associate a certain key with a given e-mail address automatically,
        either because the recipient's public key can't be deduced from the
        destination address, or because, for some reasons, you need to override
        the key NeoMutt would normally use. The <command>crypt-hook</command>
        command provides a method by which you can specify the ID of the public
        key to be used when encrypting messages to a certain recipient. You may
        use multiple crypt-hooks with the same regex; multiple matching
        crypt-hooks result in the use of multiple keyids for a recipient.
        During key selection, NeoMutt will confirm whether each crypt-hook is
        to be used (unless the
        <link linkend="crypt-confirmhook">$crypt_confirmhook</link> option is
        unset). If all crypt-hooks for a recipient are declined, NeoMutt will
        use the original recipient address for key selection instead.
      </para>
      <para>
        The meaning of <emphasis>keyid</emphasis> is to be taken broadly in

      <para>
        The <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>expando
        <emphasis>%@name@</emphasis>specifies a placeholder for the injection.
        Index-format-hooks with the same <emphasis>name</emphasis>are matched using
        <link linkend="patterns"> <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> </link>against the
        current message. Matching is done in the order specified in the .muttrc,
        with the first match being used. The hook's
        <emphasis>format-string</emphasis>is then substituted and evaluated.
      </para>
      <para>
        Because the first match is used, best practice is to put a catch-all
        <emphasis>~A</emphasis>pattern as the last hook. Here is an example showing
        how to implement dynamic date formatting:
      </para>
<screen>

index-format-hook  date  "~A"       "%[%m/%y]"
</screen>
      <para>
        Another example, showing a way to prepend to
        the subject. Note that without a catch-all ~A

        function names like the sequence string in the
        <link linkend="macro">macro</link> command. You may use it to
        automatically run a sequence of commands at startup, or when entering

        For using functions like shown in the example, it's important to use

        <quote><literal>push collapse-all</literal></quote> would be

        Keystrokes can be used, too, but are less portable because of

      <para>
        The <command>score</command> commands adds <emphasis>value</emphasis>
        to a message's score if <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> matches it.
        <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> is a string in the format described in the
        <link linkend="patterns">patterns</link> section (note: For efficiency
        reasons, patterns which scan information not available in the index,
        such as <literal>~b</literal>, <literal>~B</literal>,
        <literal>~h</literal>, <literal>~M</literal>, or <literal>~X</literal>
        may not be used).  <emphasis>value</emphasis> is a positive or negative
        integer. A message's final score is the sum total of all matching
        <command>score</command> entries. However, you may optionally prefix
        <emphasis>value</emphasis> with an equal sign (<quote>=</quote>) to
        cause evaluation to stop at a particular entry if there is a match.
        Negative final scores are rounded up to 0.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <command>unscore</command> command removes score entries from the
        list. You <emphasis>must</emphasis> specify the same pattern specified
        in the <command>score</command> command for it to be removed. The
        pattern <quote>*</quote> is a special token which means to clear the
        list of all score entries.
      </para>
      <para>
        Scoring occurs as the messages are read in, before the mailbox is
        sorted. Because of this, patterns which depend on threading, such as
        <emphasis>~=</emphasis>, <emphasis>~$</emphasis>, and
        <emphasis>~()</emphasis>, will not work by default. A workaround is to
        push the scoring command in a folder hook. This will cause the mailbox
        to be rescored after it is opened and input starts being processed:
      </para>

<screen>
folder-hook . 'push "&lt;enter-command&gt;score ~= 10&lt;enter&gt;"'

      <para>
        NeoMutt has generalized support for external spam-scoring filters. By
        defining your spam patterns with the <command>spam</command> and
        <literal>nospam</literal> commands, you can <emphasis>limit</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>search</emphasis>, and <emphasis>sort</emphasis> your mail
        based on its spam attributes, as determined by the external filter. You
        also can display the spam attributes in your index display using the
        <literal>%H</literal> selector in the
        <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable. (Tip: try
        <literal>%?H?[%H] ?</literal> to display spam tags only when they are
        defined for a given message.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Note: the value displayed by <literal>%H</literal>and searched by
        <literal>~H</literal>is stored in the
        <link linkend="caching">header cache</link>. NeoMutt isn't smart enough to
        invalidate a header cache entry based on changing <literal>spam</literal>
        rules, so if you aren't seeing correct <literal>%H</literal>values, try
        temporarily turning off the header cache. If that fixes the problem,
        then once your spam rules are set to your liking, remove your stale
        header cache files and turn the header cache back on.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your first step is to define your external filter's spam patterns using
        the <command>spam</command> command. <emphasis>pattern</emphasis>
        should be a regular expression that matches a header in a mail message.
        If any message in the mailbox matches this regular expression, it will
        receive a <quote>spam tag</quote> or <quote>spam attribute</quote>
        (unless it also matches a <command>nospam</command> pattern – see
        below.) The appearance of this attribute is entirely up to you, and is
        governed by the <emphasis>format</emphasis> parameter.
        <emphasis>format</emphasis> can be any static text, but it also can
        include back-references from the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis>
        expression. (A regular expression <quote>back-reference</quote> refers
        to a sub-expression contained within parentheses.)
        <literal>%1</literal> is replaced with the first back-reference in the
        regex, <literal>%2</literal> with the second, etc.
      </para>
      <para>
        To match spam tags, NeoMutt needs the corresponding header information
        which is always the case for local and POP folders but not for IMAP in
        the default configuration. Depending on the spam header to be analyzed,
        <link linkend="imap-headers">$imap_headers</link> may need to be
        adjusted.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you're using multiple spam filters, a message can have more than one
        spam-related header. You can define <command>spam</command> patterns
        for each filter you use. If a message matches two or more of these
        patterns, and the <link linkend="spam-separator">$spam_separator</link>
        variable is set to a string, then the message's spam tag will consist
        of all the <emphasis>format</emphasis> strings joined together, with
        the value of <link linkend="spam-separator">$spam_separator</link>
        separating them.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, suppose one uses DCC, SpamAssassin, and PureMessage, then
        the configuration might look like in <xref linkend="ex-spam" />.
      </para>
      <example id="ex-spam">
        <title>Configuring spam detection</title>

<screen>
spam "X-DCC-.*-Metrics:.*(....)=many"         "90+/DCC-%1"
spam "X-Spam-Status: Yes"                     "90+/SA"
spam "X-PerlMX-Spam: .*Probability=([0-9]+)%" "%1/PM"
set spam_separator=", "
</screen>

      </example>
      <para>
        If then a message is received that DCC registered with
        <quote>many</quote> hits under the <quote>Fuz2</quote> checksum, and
        that PureMessage registered with a 97% probability of being spam, that
        message's spam tag would read <literal>90+/DCC-Fuz2, 97/PM</literal>.
        (The four characters before <quote>=many</quote> in a DCC report
        indicate the checksum used – in this case, <quote>Fuz2</quote>.)
      </para>
      <para>
        If the <link linkend="spam-separator">$spam_separator</link> variable
        is unset, then each spam pattern match supersedes the previous one.
        Instead of getting joined <emphasis>format</emphasis> strings, you'll
        get only the last one to match.
      </para>
      <para>
        The spam tag is what will be displayed in the index when you use
        <literal>%H</literal> in the
        <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable. It's also
        the string that the <literal>~H</literal> pattern-matching expression
        matches against for <literal>&lt;search&gt;</literal> and
        <literal>&lt;limit&gt;</literal> functions. And it's what sorting by
        spam attribute will use as a sort key.
      </para>
      <para>
        That's a pretty complicated example, and most people's actual
        environments will have only one spam filter. The simpler your
        configuration, the more effective NeoMutt can be, especially when it
        comes to sorting.
      </para>
      <para>
        Generally, when you sort by spam tag, NeoMutt will sort
        <emphasis>lexically</emphasis> – that is, by ordering strings
        alphanumerically. However, if a spam tag begins with a number, NeoMutt
        will sort numerically first, and lexically only when two numbers are
        equal in value. (This is like UNIX's <literal>sort -n</literal>.)
        A message with no spam attributes at all – that is, one that didn't
        match <emphasis>any</emphasis> of your <command>spam</command> patterns
        – is sorted at lowest priority. Numbers are sorted next, beginning with
        0 and ranging upward. Finally, non-numeric strings are sorted, with
        <quote>a</quote> taking lower priority than <quote>z</quote>. Clearly,
        in general, sorting by spam tags is most effective when you can coerce
        your filter to give you a raw number. But in case you can't, NeoMutt
        can still do something useful.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <command>nospam</command> command can be used to write exceptions
        to <command>spam</command> patterns. If a header pattern matches
        something in a <command>spam</command> command, but you nonetheless do
        not want it to receive a spam tag, you can list a more precise pattern
        under a <command>nospam</command> command.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> given to <command>nospam</command>
        is exactly the same as the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> on an existing
        <command>spam</command> list entry, the effect will be to remove the
        entry from the spam list, instead of adding an exception. Likewise, if
        the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> for a <command>spam</command> command
        matches an entry on the <command>nospam</command> list, that nospam
        entry will be removed. If the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> for
        <command>nospam</command> is <quote>*</quote>,
        <emphasis>all entries on both lists</emphasis> will be removed. This
        might be the default action if you use <command>spam</command> and
        <command>nospam</command> in conjunction with
        a <command>folder-hook</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can have as many <command>spam</command> or
        <command>nospam</command> commands as you like. You can even do your
        own primitive <command>spam</command> detection within NeoMutt – for
        example, if you consider all mail from <literal>MAILER-DAEMON</literal>
        to be spam, you can use a <command>spam</command> command like this:
      </para>
      <screen>spam "^From: .*MAILER-DAEMON"       "999"</screen>

          consist of any number of printable characters and must be enclosed in
          quotes if they contain spaces or tabs. You may also use the escape
          sequences <quote>\n</quote> and <quote>\t</quote> for newline and
          tab, respectively. <emphasis>quadoption</emphasis> variables are
          used to control whether or not to be prompted for certain actions, or
          to specify a default action. A value of <emphasis>yes</emphasis>
          will cause the action to be carried out automatically as if you had
          answered yes to the question. Similarly, a value of
          <emphasis>no</emphasis> will cause the action to be carried out as if
          you had answered <quote>no.</quote> A value of
          <emphasis>ask-yes</emphasis> will cause a prompt with a default
          answer of <quote>yes</quote> and <emphasis>ask-no</emphasis> will
          provide a default answer of <quote>no.</quote>
        </para>
        <para>
          Prefixing a variable with <quote>no</quote> will unset it. Example:
          <literal><command>set</command> noaskbcc</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
          For <emphasis>boolean</emphasis> variables, you may optionally prefix
          the variable name with <literal>inv</literal> to toggle the value (on
          or off). This is useful when writing macros. Example:
          <literal><command>set</command> invsmart_wrap</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <command>toggle</command> command automatically prepends the
          <literal>inv</literal> prefix to all specified variables.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <command>unset</command> command automatically prepends the
          <literal>no</literal> prefix to all specified variables.

        <para>
          Using the <literal>&lt;enter-command&gt;</literal> function in the
          <emphasis>index</emphasis> menu, you can query the value of
          a variable by prefixing the name of the variable with a question
          mark:
        </para>
        <screen>set ?allow_8bit</screen>
        <para>
          The question mark is actually only required for boolean and
          quadoption variables.

        <para>
          The <command>reset</command> command resets all given variables to
          the compile time defaults (hopefully mentioned in this manual). If
          you use the command <command>set</command> and prefix the variable
          with <quote>&amp;</quote> this has the same behavior as the
          <command>reset</command> command.
        </para>
        <para>
          With the <command>reset</command> command there exists the special

          Variables are always assigned string values which NeoMutt parses into
          its internal representation according to the type of the variable,
          for example an integer number for numeric types. For all queries
          (including $-expansion) the value is converted from its internal type
          back into string. As a result, any variable can be assigned any value
          given that its content is valid for the target. This also counts for
          custom variables which are of type string. In case of parsing errors,
          NeoMutt will print error messages. <xref linkend="ex-myvar4" />
          demonstrates type conversions.

          Type conversion applies to all configuration commands which take

      <sect2 id="formatstrings-basics">
        <title>Basic usage</title>
        <para>
          Format strings are a general concept you'll find in several locations
          through the NeoMutt configuration, especially in the
          <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>,
          <link linkend="pager-format">$pager_format</link>,
          <link linkend="status-format">$status_format</link>, and other
          related variables. These can be very straightforward, and it's quite
          possible you already know how to use them.
        </para>
        <para>
          The most basic format string element is a percent symbol followed by
          another character. For example, <literal>%s</literal> represents
          a message's Subject: header in the
          <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable. The
          <quote>expandos</quote> available are documented with each format
          variable, but there are general modifiers available with all
          formatting expandos, too. Those are our concern here.
        </para>
        <para>
          Some of the modifiers are borrowed right out of C (though you might
          know them from Perl, Python, shell, or another language). These are
          the <literal>[-]m.n</literal> modifiers, as in
          <literal>%-12.12s</literal>. As with such programming languages,
          these modifiers allow you to specify the minimum and maximum size of
          the resulting string, as well as its justification. If the
          <quote>-</quote> sign follows the percent, the string will be
          left-justified instead of right-justified. If there's a number
          immediately following that, it's the minimum amount of space the
          formatted string will occupy – if it's naturally smaller than that,
          it will be padded out with spaces. If a decimal point and another
          number follow, that's the maximum space allowable – the string will
          not be permitted to exceed that width, no matter its natural size.
          Each of these three elements is optional, so that all these are legal
          format strings: <literal>%-12s</literal>, <literal>%4c</literal>,
          <literal>%.15F</literal> and <literal>%-12.15L</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
          NeoMutt adds some other modifiers to format strings. If you use an
          equals symbol (<literal>=</literal>) as a numeric prefix (like the
          minus above), it will force the string to be centered within its
          minimum space range. For example, <literal>%=14y</literal> will
          reserve 14 characters for the %y expansion – that's the set of
          message keywords (formerly X-Label). If the expansion results in
          a string less than 14 characters, it will be centered in
          a 14-character space. If the X-Label for a message were
          <quote>test</quote>, that expansion would look like
          <quote>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;test&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</quote>.
        </para>
        <para>
          There are two very little-known modifiers that affect the way that an
          expando is replaced. If there is an underline (<quote>_</quote>)
          character between any format modifiers (as above) and the expando
          letter, it will expands in all lower case. And if you use a colon
          (<quote>:</quote>), it will replace all decimal points with
          underlines.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="formatstrings-conditionals">
        <title>Conditionals</title>
        <para>
          Depending on the format string variable, some of its sequences can be
          used to optionally print a string if their value is nonzero. For
          example, you may only want to see the number of flagged messages if
          such messages exist, since zero is not particularly meaningful. To
          optionally print a string based upon one of the above sequences, the
          following construct is used:
        </para>
        <screen>%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;optional_string&gt;?</screen>
        <para>
          where <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is an expando, and
          <emphasis>optional_string</emphasis> is the string you would like
          printed if <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is nonzero.
          <emphasis>optional_string</emphasis> may contain other sequences as
          well as normal text, but you may not nest optional strings.
        </para>
        <para>
          Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
          new messages in a mailbox in
          <link linkend="status-format">$status_format</link>:
        </para>
        <screen>%?n?%n new messages.?</screen>
        <para>
          You can also switch between two strings using the following
          construct:
        </para>

<screen>
%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;if_string&gt;&amp;&lt;else_string&gt;?
</screen>

        <para>
          If the value of <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is non-zero,
          <emphasis>if_string</emphasis> will be expanded, otherwise
          <emphasis>else_string</emphasis> will be expanded.
        </para>
        <para>
          The conditional sequences can also be nested by using the %&lt; and
          &gt; operators. The %? notation can still be used but requires
          quoting. For example:
        </para>

<screen>
%&lt;x?true&amp;false&gt;
%&lt;x?%&lt;y?%&lt;z?xyz&amp;xy&gt;&amp;x&gt;&amp;none&gt;

      <sect2 id="formatstrings-filters">
        <title>Filters</title>
        <para>
          Any format string ending in a vertical bar (<quote>|</quote>) will
          be expanded and piped through the first word in the string, using
          spaces as separator. The string returned will be used for display. If
          the returned string ends in %, it will be passed through the
          formatter a second time. This allows the filter to generate
          a replacement format string including % expandos.
        </para>
        <para>
          All % expandos in a format string are expanded before the script is
          called so that:

        <para>
          will make NeoMutt expand <literal>%r</literal>, <literal>%f</literal>
          and <literal>%L</literal> before calling the script. The example also
          shows that arguments can be quoted: the script will receive the
          expanded string between the single quotes as the only argument.
        </para>
        <para>
          A practical example is the <literal>mutt_xtitle</literal> script
          installed in the <literal>samples</literal> subdirectory of the
          NeoMutt documentation: it can be used as filter for
          <link linkend="status-format">$status_format</link> to set the
          current terminal's title, if supported.

      <sect2 id="formatstrings-padding">
        <title>Padding</title>
        <para>
          In most format strings, NeoMutt supports different types of padding
          using special %-expandos:
        </para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>
              <literal>%|X</literal>

            <listitem>
              <para>
                When this occurs, NeoMutt will fill the rest of the line with
                the character <literal>X</literal>. For example, filling the
                rest of the line with dashes is done by setting:
              </para>

<screen>
set status_format = "%v on %h: %B: %?n?%n&amp;no? new messages %|-"

                Since the previous expando stops at the end of line, there must
                be a way to fill the gap between two items via the
                <literal>%&gt;X</literal> expando: it puts as many characters
                <literal>X</literal> in between two items so that the rest of
                the line will be right-justified. For example, to not put the
                version string and hostname the above example on the left but
                on the right and fill the gap with spaces, one might use (note
                the space after <literal>%&gt;</literal>):

                Normal right-justification will print everything to the left of
                the <literal>%&gt;</literal>, displaying padding and whatever
                lies to the right only if there's room. By contrast,
                <quote>soft-fill</quote> gives priority to the right-hand side,
                guaranteeing space to display it and showing padding only if
                there's still room. If necessary, soft-fill will eat text
                leftwards to make room for rightward text. For example, to
                right-justify the subject making sure as much as possible of it
                fits on screen, one might use (note two spaces after
                <literal>%*</literal>: the second ensures there's a space
                between the truncated right-hand side and the subject):

      <title>Character Set Handling</title>
      <para>
        A <quote>character set</quote> is basically a mapping between bytes and
        glyphs and implies a certain character encoding scheme. For example,
        for the ISO 8859 family of character sets, an encoding of 8bit per
        character is used. For the Unicode character set, different character
        encodings may be used, UTF-8 being the most popular. In UTF-8,
        a character is represented using a variable number of bytes ranging
        from 1 to 4.
      </para>
      <para>
        Since NeoMutt is a command-line tool run from a shell, and delegates
        certain tasks to external tools (such as an editor for
        composing/editing messages), all of these tools need to agree on
        a character set and encoding. There exists no way to reliably deduce
        the character set a plain text file has. Interoperability is gained by
        the use of well-defined environment variables. The full set can be
        printed by issuing <literal>locale</literal> on the command line.
      </para>
      <para>
        Upon startup, NeoMutt determines the character set on its own using
        routines that inspect locale-specific environment variables. Therefore,
        it is generally not necessary to set the <literal>$charset</literal>
        variable in NeoMutt. It may even be counter-productive as NeoMutt uses
        system and library functions that derive the character set themselves
        and on which NeoMutt has no influence. It's safest to let NeoMutt work
        out the locale setup itself.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you happen to work with several character sets on a regular basis,
        it's highly advisable to use Unicode and an UTF-8 locale. Unicode can
        represent nearly all characters in a message at the same time. When not
        using a Unicode locale, it may happen that you receive messages with
        characters not representable in your locale. When displaying such
        a message, or replying to or forwarding it, information may get lost
        possibly rendering the message unusable (not only for you but also for
        the recipient, this breakage is not reversible as lost information
        cannot be guessed).
      </para>
      <para>
        A Unicode locale makes all conversions superfluous which eliminates the
        risk of conversion errors. It also eliminates potentially wrong
        expectations about the character set between NeoMutt and external
        programs.
      </para>
      <para>
        The terminal emulator used also must be properly configured for the
        current locale. Terminal emulators usually do <emphasis>not</emphasis>
        derive the locale from environment variables, they need to be
        configured separately. If the terminal is incorrectly configured,
        NeoMutt may display random and unexpected characters (question marks,
        octal codes, or just random glyphs), format strings may not work as
        expected, you may not be abled to enter non-ascii characters, and
        possible more. Data is always represented using bytes and so a correct
        setup is very important as to the machine, all character sets
        <quote>look</quote> the same.
      </para>
      <para>
        Warning: A mismatch between what system and library functions think the
        locale is and what NeoMutt was told what the locale is may make it
        behave badly with non-ascii input: it will fail at seemingly random
        places. This warning is to be taken seriously since not only local mail
        handling may suffer: sent messages may carry wrong character set
        information the <emphasis>receiver</emphasis> has too deal with. The
        need to set <literal>$charset</literal> directly in most cases points
        at terminal and environment variable setup problems, not NeoMutt
        problems.

        A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.
        Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
        expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          The regular expression can be enclosed/delimited by either " or
          ' which is useful if the regular expression includes a white-space
          character. See <xref linkend="neomuttrc-syntax" /> for more
          information on " and ' delimiter processing. To match a literal " or
          ' you must preface it with \ (backslash).
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match
        a single character. Most characters, including all letters and digits,
        are regular expressions that match themselves. Any metacharacter with
        special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.
      </para>
      <para>
        The period <quote>.</quote> matches any single character. The caret
        <quote>^</quote> and the dollar sign <quote>$</quote> are
        metacharacters that respectively match the empty string at the
        beginning and end of a line.
      </para>
      <para>
        A list of characters enclosed by <quote>[</quote> and <quote>]</quote>
        matches any single character in that list; if the first character of
        the list is a caret <quote>^</quote> then it matches any character
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> in the list. For example, the regular
        expression <emphasis>[0123456789]</emphasis> matches any single digit.
        A range of ASCII characters may be specified by giving the first and
        last characters, separated by a hyphen <quote>-</quote>. Most
        metacharacters lose their special meaning inside lists. To include
        a literal <quote>]</quote> place it first in the list. Similarly, to
        include a literal <quote>^</quote> place it anywhere but first.
        Finally, to include a literal hyphen <quote>-</quote> place it last.
      </para>
      <para>
        Certain named classes of characters are predefined. Character classes

              of: <quote>e</quote> with grave (<quote>è</quote>),
              <quote>e</quote> with acute (<quote>é</quote>) and

        Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
        expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings
        that respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.
      </para>
      <para>
        Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator
        <quote>|</quote>; the resulting regular expression matches any string
        matching either subexpression.
      </para>
      <para>
        Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
        precedence over alternation. A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
        parentheses to override these precedence rules.

          <link linkend="addrgroup">address group</link>.
        </para>
        <para>
          a) The forms <quote>&lt;[<emphasis>MAX</emphasis>]</quote>,
          <quote>&gt;[<emphasis>MIN</emphasis>]</quote>,
          <quote>[<emphasis>MIN</emphasis>]-</quote> and

        </para>
        <para>
          b) The suffixes <quote>K</quote> and <quote>M</quote> are allowed to
          specify kilobyte and megabyte respectively.
        </para>
        <para>
          c) The message number ranges (introduced by <literal>~m</literal>)
          are even more general and powerful than the other types of ranges.
          Read on and see <xref linkend="message-ranges" /> below.
        </para>
        <para>
          d) These patterns read each message in, and can therefore be much
          slower.  Over IMAP this will entail downloading each message.  They
          can not be used for <link linkend="score-command">message scoring</link>,
          and it is recommended to avoid using them for index coloring.
        </para>
        <para>
          Special attention has to be paid when using regular expressions
          inside of patterns. Specifically, NeoMutt's parser for these patterns
          will strip one level of backslash (<quote>\</quote>), which is
          normally used for quoting. If it is your intention to use a backslash
          in the regular expression, you will need to use two backslashes
          instead (<quote>\\</quote>).
        </para>
        <para>
          You can force NeoMutt to treat
          <emphasis>EXPR</emphasis> as a simple substring instead of a regular
          expression by using = instead of ~ in the pattern name. For example,
          <literal>=b *.*</literal> will find all messages that contain the
          literal string <quote>*.*</quote>. Simple string matches are less
          powerful than regular expressions but can be considerably faster.
        </para>
        <para>
          For IMAP folders, string matches <literal>=b</literal>,
          <literal>=B</literal>, and <literal>=h</literal> will be performed on
          the server instead of by fetching every message. IMAP treats
          <literal>=h</literal> specially: it must be of the form
          <quote>header: substring</quote> and will not partially match header
          names. The substring part may be omitted if you simply wish to find
          messages containing a particular header without regard to its value.
        </para>
        <para>
          Patterns matching lists of addresses (notably c, C, p, P and t) match
          if there is at least one match in the whole list. If you want to make
          sure that all elements of that list match, you need to prefix your
          pattern with <quote>^</quote>. This example matches all mails which
          only has recipients from Germany.
        </para>

        </example>
        <para>
          You can restrict address pattern matching to aliases that you have
          defined with the "@" modifier. This example matches messages whose
          recipients are all from Germany, and who are known to your alias
          list.

        <para>
          To match any defined alias, use a regular expression that matches any
          string. This example matches messages whose senders are known
          aliases.

            If a message number range (from now on: MNR) contains a comma
            (<literal>,</literal>), it is a <emphasis>relative</emphasis> MNR.
            That means the numbers denote <emphasis>offsets</emphasis> from the
            highlighted message. For example:

            In addition to numbers, either side of the range can also contain

          <para>
            Lastly, you can also leave either side of the range blank, to make
            it extend as far as possible. For example, <literal>~m ,1</literal>
            has the same meaning as the last example in

            Otherwise, if a MNR <emphasis>doesn't</emphasis> contain a comma,
            the meaning is similar to other ranges, except that the shortcuts
            are still available. Examples:

        <title>Simple Searches</title>
        <para>
          NeoMutt supports two versions of so called
          <quote>simple searches</quote>. These are issued if the query entered
          for searching, limiting and similar operations does not seem to
          contain a valid pattern modifier (i.e. it does not contain one of
          these characters: <quote>~</quote>, <quote>=</quote> or
          <quote>%</quote>). If the query is supposed to contain one of these
          special characters, they must be escaped by prepending a backslash
          (<quote>\</quote>).
        </para>
        <para>
          The first type is by checking whether the query string equals
          a keyword case-insensitively from
          <xref linkend="tab-simplesearch-keywords" />: If that is the case,
          NeoMutt will use the shown pattern modifier instead. If a keyword
          would conflict with your search keyword, you need to turn it into
          a regular expression to avoid matching the keyword table. For
          example, if you want to find all messages matching
          <quote>flag</quote> (using
          <link linkend="simple-search">$simple_search</link>) but don't want
          to match flagged messages, simply search for
          <quote><literal>[f]lag</literal></quote>.

        </table>
        <para>
          The second type of simple search is to build a complex search pattern
          using <link linkend="simple-search">$simple_search</link> as
          a template. NeoMutt will insert your query properly quoted and search
          for the composed complex query.

          Logical AND is performed by specifying more than one criterion. For
          example:
        </para>
        <screen>~t work ~f elkins</screen>
        <para>
          would select messages which contain the word <quote>work</quote> in
          the list of recipients <emphasis>and</emphasis> that have the word
          <quote>elkins</quote> in the <quote>From</quote> header field.
        </para>
        <para>
          NeoMutt also recognizes the following operators to create more
          complex search patterns:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              ! – logical NOT operator

          <listitem>
            <para>
              | – logical OR operator

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              () – logical grouping operator
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
          Here is an example illustrating a complex search pattern. This
          pattern will select all messages which do not contain
          <quote>work</quote> in the <quote>To</quote> or <quote>Cc</quote>
          field and which are from <quote>elkins</quote>.

          <title>Using boolean operators in patterns</title>
          <screen>!(~t work|~c work) ~f elkins</screen>
        </example>
        <para>
          Here is an example using white space in the regular expression (note
          the <quote>'</quote> and <quote>"</quote> delimiters). For this to
          match, the mail's subject must match the
          <quote>^Junk +From +Me$</quote> and it must be from either
          <quote>Jim +Somebody</quote> or <quote>Ed +SomeoneElse</quote>:
        </para>

<screen>
'~s "^Junk +From +Me$" ~f ("Jim +Somebody"|"Ed +SomeoneElse")'
</screen>

        <note>
          <para>
            If a regular expression contains parenthesis, or a vertical bar
            ("|"), you <emphasis>must</emphasis> enclose the expression in
            double or single quotes since those characters are also used to
            separate different parts of NeoMutt's pattern language. For
            example: <literal>~f "user@(home\.org|work\.com)"</literal> Without
            the quotes, the parenthesis wouldn't end. This would be separated
            to two OR'd patterns: <emphasis>~f user@(home\.org</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>work\.com)</emphasis>. They are never what you want.

      <sect2 id="date-patterns">
        <title>Searching by Date</title>
        <para>
          NeoMutt supports two types of dates, <emphasis>absolute</emphasis>
          and <emphasis>relative</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <sect3 id="date-absolute">
          <title>Absolute Dates</title>
          <para>
            Dates <emphasis>must</emphasis> be in DD/MM/YY format (month and year
            are optional, defaulting to the current month and year) or YYYYMMDD.  An
            example of a valid range of dates is:
          </para>
<screen>
Limit to messages matching: ~d 20/1/95-31/10
Limit to messages matching: ~d 19950120-19951031
</screen>
          <para>
            If you omit the minimum (first) date, and just specify
            <quote>-DD/MM/YY</quote> or <quote>-YYYYMMDD</quote>, all messages
            <emphasis>before</emphasis> the given date will be selected.  If you omit the
            maximum(second) date, and specify <quote>DD/MM/YY-</quote>, all messages
            <emphasis>after</emphasis> the given date will be selected. If you
            specify a single date with no dash (<quote>-</quote>), only
            messages sent on the given date will be selected.
          </para>
          <para>
            You can add error margins to absolute dates. An error margin is
            a sign (+ or -), followed by a digit, followed by one of the units
            in <xref linkend="tab-date-units" />. As a special case, you can
            replace the sign by a <quote>*</quote> character, which is
            equivalent to giving identical plus and minus error margins.

      <title>Marking Messages</title>
      <para>
        There are times that it's useful to ask NeoMutt to "remember" which
        message you're currently looking at, while you move elsewhere in your
        mailbox. You can do this with the <quote>mark-message</quote> operator,
        which is bound to the <quote>~</quote> key by default. Press this key
        to enter an identifier for the marked message. When you want to return
        to this message, press <quote>'</quote> and the name that you
        previously entered.
      </para>
      <para>
        (Message marking is really just a shortcut for defining a macro that
        returns you to the current message by searching for its Message-ID.
        You can choose a different prefix by setting the
        <link linkend="mark-macro-prefix">$mark_macro_prefix</link> variable.)

    <sect1 id="tags">
      <title>Using Tags</title>
      <para>
        Sometimes it is desirable to perform an operation on a group of
        messages all at once rather than one at a time. An example might be to
        save messages to a mailing list to a separate folder, or to delete all
        messages with a given subject. To tag all messages matching a pattern,
        use the <literal>&lt;tag-pattern&gt;</literal> function, which is bound
        to <quote>shift-T</quote> by default. Or you can select individual
        messages by hand using the <literal>&lt;tag-message&gt;</literal>
        function, which is bound to <quote>t</quote> by default. See
        <link linkend="patterns">patterns</link> for NeoMutt's pattern matching
        syntax.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you have tagged the desired messages, you can use the
        <quote>tag-prefix</quote> operator, which is the <quote>;</quote>
        (semicolon) key by default. When the <quote>tag-prefix</quote> operator
        is used, the <emphasis>next</emphasis> operation will be applied to all
        tagged messages if that operation can be used in that manner. If the
        <link linkend="auto-tag">$auto_tag</link> variable is set, the next
        operation applies to the tagged messages automatically, without
        requiring the <quote>tag-prefix</quote>.

      <para>
        In <link linkend="macro"><command>macro</command></link>s or
        <link linkend="push"><command>push</command></link> commands, you can
        use the <literal>&lt;tag-prefix-cond&gt;</literal> operator. If there
        are no tagged messages, NeoMutt will <quote>eat</quote> the rest of the
        macro to abort its execution. NeoMutt will stop <quote>eating</quote>
        the macro when it encounters the <literal>&lt;end-cond&gt;</literal>
        operator; after this operator the rest of the macro will be executed as
        normal.

          If a hook changes configuration settings, these changes remain
          effective until the end of the current NeoMutt session. As this is
          generally not desired, a <quote>default</quote> hook needs to be
          added before all other hooks of that type to restore configuration
          defaults.

          <link linkend="regex">regular expression</link> is sufficient. But in
          dealing with messages a finer grain of control is needed for matching
          since for different purposes you want to match different criteria.
        </para>
        <para>
          NeoMutt allows the use of the
          <link linkend="patterns">search pattern</link> language for matching
          messages in hook commands. This works in exactly the same way as it
          would when <emphasis>limiting</emphasis> or
          <emphasis>searching</emphasis> the mailbox, except that you are
          restricted to those operators which match information NeoMutt
          extracts from the header of the message (i.e., from, to, cc, date,
          subject, etc.).
        </para>
        <para>
          For example, if you wanted to set your return address based upon
          sending mail to a specific address, you could do something like:
        </para>

<screen>
send-hook '~t ^user@work\.com$' 'my_hdr From: John Smith &lt;user@host&gt;'
</screen>

        <para>
          which would execute the given command when sending mail to
          <emphasis>user@work.com</emphasis>.
        </para>
        <para>
          However, it is not required that you write the pattern to match using
          the full searching language. You can still specify a simple
          <emphasis>regular expression</emphasis> like the other hooks, in
          which case NeoMutt will translate your pattern into the full
          language, using the translation specified by the
          <link linkend="default-hook">$default_hook</link> variable. The
          pattern is translated at the time the hook is declared, so the value
          of <link linkend="default-hook">$default_hook</link> that is in
          effect at that time will be used.

          <link linkend="shortcuts">mailbox shortcut</link> expansion on the
          regex parameter. There is some overlap between these, so special

        <para>
          Keep in mind that mailbox shortcut expansion on the regex parameter
          takes place when the hook is initially parsed, not when the hook is
          matching against a mailbox. When NeoMutt starts up and is reading the
          .neomuttrc, some mailbox shortcuts may not be usable. For example,
          the "current mailbox" shortcut, ^, will expand to an empty string
          because no mailbox has been opened yet. NeoMutt will issue an error
          for this case or if the mailbox shortcut results in an empty regex.

        NeoMutt supports connecting to external directory databases such as

        NeoMutt using a simple interface. Using the

        The wrapper script should accept the query on the command-line. It

        a single line, each line containing a tab separated address then name
        then some other optional information. On error, or if there are no

      <para>
        There are two mechanisms for accessing the query function of NeoMutt.
        One is to do a query from the index menu using the
        <literal>&lt;query&gt;</literal> function (default: Q). This will
        prompt for a query, then bring up the query menu which will list the
        matching responses. From the query menu, you can select addresses to
        create aliases, or to mail. You can tag multiple addresses to mail,
        start a new query, or have a new query appended to the current
        responses.
      </para>
      <para>
        The other mechanism for accessing the query function is for address
        completion, similar to the alias completion. In any prompt for address
        entry, you can use the <literal>&lt;complete-query&gt;</literal>
        function (default: ^T) to run a query based on the current address you
        have typed. Like aliases, NeoMutt will look for what you have typed
        back to the last space or comma. If there is a single response for that
        query, NeoMutt will expand the address in place. If there are multiple
        responses, NeoMutt will activate the query menu. At the query menu, you
        can select one or more addresses to be added to the prompt.

      <title>Mailbox Formats</title>
      <para>
        NeoMutt supports reading and writing of four different local mailbox
        formats: mbox, MMDF, MH and Maildir. The mailbox type is auto detected,
        so there is no need to use a flag for different mailbox types. When
        creating new mailboxes, NeoMutt uses the default specified with the
        <link linkend="mbox-type">$mbox_type</link> variable. A short
        description of the formats follows.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>mbox</emphasis>. This is a widely used mailbox format for
        UNIX. All messages are stored in a single file. Each message has
        a line of the form:
      </para>
      <screen>From me@cs.hmc.edu Fri, 11 Apr 1997 11:44:56 PST</screen>
      <para>
        to denote the start of a new message (this is often referred to as the
        <quote>From_</quote> line). The mbox format requires mailbox locking,
        is prone to mailbox corruption with concurrently writing clients or
        misinterpreted From_ lines. Depending on the environment, new mail
        detection can be unreliable. Mbox folders are fast to open and easy to
        archive.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>MMDF</emphasis>. This is a variant of the
        <emphasis>mbox</emphasis> format. Each message is surrounded by lines
        containing <quote>^A^A^A^A</quote> (four times control-A's). The same
        problems as for mbox apply (also with finding the right message
        separator as four control-A's may appear in message bodies).
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>MH</emphasis>. A radical departure from
        <emphasis>mbox</emphasis> and <emphasis>MMDF</emphasis>, a mailbox
        consists of a directory and each message is stored in a separate file.
        The filename indicates the message number (however, this is may not
        correspond to the message number NeoMutt displays). Deleted messages
        are renamed with a comma (<quote>,</quote>) prepended to the filename.
        NeoMutt detects this type of mailbox by looking for either
        <literal>.mh_sequences</literal> or <literal>.xmhcache</literal> files
        (needed to distinguish normal directories from MH mailboxes). MH is
        more robust with concurrent clients writing the mailbox, but still may
        suffer from lost flags; message corruption is less likely to occur than
        with mbox/mmdf. It's usually slower to open compared to mbox/mmdf since
        many small files have to be read (NeoMutt provides
        <xref linkend="header-caching" /> to greatly speed this process up).
        Depending on the environment, MH is not very disk-space efficient.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Maildir</emphasis>. The newest of the mailbox formats, used
        by the Qmail MTA (a replacement for sendmail). Similar to
        <emphasis>MH</emphasis>, except that it adds three subdirectories of
        the mailbox: <emphasis>tmp</emphasis>, <emphasis>new</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>cur</emphasis>. Filenames for the messages are chosen in such
        a way they are unique, even when two programs are writing the mailbox
        over NFS, which means that no file locking is needed and corruption is
        very unlikely. Maildir maybe slower to open without caching in NeoMutt,
        it too is not very disk-space efficient depending on the environment.
        Since no additional files are used for metadata (which is embedded in
        the message filenames) and Maildir is locking-free, it's easy to sync
        across different machines using file-level synchronization tools.

        There are a number of built in shortcuts which refer to specific

    <sect1 id="using-lists">
      <title>Handling Mailing Lists</title>
      <para>
        NeoMutt has a few configuration options that make dealing with large
        amounts of mail easier. The first thing you must do is to let NeoMutt
        know what addresses you consider to be mailing lists (technically this
        does not have to be a mailing list, but that is what it is most often
        used for), and what lists you are subscribed to. This is accomplished
        through the use of the
        <link linkend="lists"><command>lists</command></link> and
        <link linkend="lists"><command>subscribe</command></link> commands in
        your <literal>.neomuttrc</literal>. Alternatively or additionally, you
        can set <link linkend="auto-subscribe">$auto_subscribe</link> to
        automatically subscribe addresses found in a <literal>List-Post</literal>
        header.
      </para>
      <para>
        Now that NeoMutt knows what your mailing lists are, it can do several
        things, the first of which is the ability to show the name of a list
        through which you received a message (i.e., of a subscribed list) in
        the <emphasis>index</emphasis> menu display. This is useful to
        distinguish between personal and list mail in the same mailbox. In the
        <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable, the expando
        <quote>%L</quote> will print the string <quote>To &lt;list&gt;</quote>
        when <quote>list</quote> appears in the <quote>To</quote> field, and
        <quote>Cc &lt;list&gt;</quote> when it appears in the <quote>Cc</quote>
        field (otherwise it prints the name of the author).
      </para>
      <para>
        Often times the <quote>To</quote> and <quote>Cc</quote> fields in
        mailing list messages tend to get quite large. Most people do not
        bother to remove the author of the message they reply to from the list,
        resulting in two or more copies being sent to that person. The
        <literal>&lt;list-reply&gt;</literal> function, which by default is
        bound to <quote>L</quote> in the <emphasis>index</emphasis> menu and
        <emphasis>pager</emphasis>, helps reduce the clutter by only replying
        to the known mailing list addresses instead of all recipients (except
        as specified by <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal>, see below).
      </para>
      <para>
        NeoMutt also supports the <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header.
        When you send a message to a list of recipients which includes one or
        several known mailing lists, and if the
        <link linkend="followup-to">$followup_to</link> option is set, NeoMutt
        will generate a Mail-Followup-To header.  If any of the recipients are
        subscribed mailing lists, this header will contain all the recipients
        to whom you send this message, but not your address. This indicates
        that group-replies or list-replies (also known as
        <quote>followups</quote>) to this message should only be sent to the
        original recipients of the message, and not separately to you - you'll
        receive your copy through one of the mailing lists you are subscribed
        to.  If none of the recipients are subscribed mailing lists, the header
        will also contain your address, ensuring you receive a copy of replies.
      </para>
      <para>
        Conversely, when group-replying or list-replying to a message which has
        a <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header, NeoMutt will respect this
        header if the
        <link linkend="honor-followup-to">$honor_followup_to</link>
        configuration variable is set. Using
        <link linkend="list-reply">list-reply</link> will in this case also
        make sure that the reply goes to the mailing list, even if it's not
        specified in the list of recipients in the
        <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal>.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          When header editing is enabled, you can create
          a <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header manually. NeoMutt will
          only auto-generate this header if it doesn't exist when you send the
          message.
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        The other method some mailing list admins use is to generate
        a <quote>Reply-To</quote> field which points back to the mailing list
        address rather than the author of the message. This can create problems
        when trying to reply directly to the author in private, since most mail
        clients will automatically reply to the address given in the
        <quote>Reply-To</quote> field. NeoMutt uses the
        <link linkend="reply-to">$reply_to</link> variable to help decide which
        address to use. If set to <emphasis>ask-yes</emphasis> or
        <emphasis>ask-no</emphasis>, you will be prompted as to whether or not
        you would like to use the address given in the <quote>Reply-To</quote>
        field, or reply directly to the address given in the
        <quote>From</quote> field. When set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, the
        <quote>Reply-To</quote> field will be used when present.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can change or delete the <quote>X-Label:</quote> field within
        NeoMutt using the <quote>edit-label</quote> command, bound to the
        <quote>y</quote> key by default. This works for tagged messages, too.
        While in the edit-label function, pressing the &lt;complete&gt; binding
        (TAB, by default) will perform completion against all labels currently
        in use.
      </para>
      <para>
        Lastly, NeoMutt has the ability to <link linkend="sort">sort</link> the
        mailbox into <link linkend="threads">threads</link>. A thread is
        a group of messages which all relate to the same subject. This is
        usually organized into a tree-like structure where a message and all of
        its replies are represented graphically. If you've ever used a threaded
        news client, this is the same concept. It makes dealing with large
        volume mailing lists easier because you can easily delete uninteresting
        threads and quickly find topics of value.

        Working within the confines of a console or terminal window, it is

      <title>New Mail Detection</title>
      <para>
        NeoMutt supports setups with multiple folders, allowing all of them to
        be monitored for new mail (see <xref linkend="mailboxes" /> for
        details).
      </para>

      <sect2 id="new-mail-formats">
        <title>How New Mail Detection Works</title>
        <para>
          For Mbox and Mmdf folders, new mail is detected by comparing access
          and/or modification times of files: NeoMutt assumes a folder has new
          mail if it wasn't accessed after it was last modified. Utilities like
          <literal>biff</literal> or <literal>frm</literal> or any other
          program which accesses the mailbox might cause NeoMutt to never
          detect new mail for that mailbox if they do not properly reset the
          access time. Other possible causes of NeoMutt not detecting new mail
          in these folders are backup tools (updating access times) or
          filesystems mounted without access time update support (for Linux
          systems, see the <literal>relatime</literal> option).
        </para>
        <note>
          <para>
            Contrary to older NeoMutt releases, it now maintains the new mail
            status of a folder by properly resetting the access time if the
            folder contains at least one message which is neither read, nor
            deleted, nor marked as old.
          </para>
        </note>
        <para>
          In cases where new mail detection for Mbox or Mmdf folders appears to
          be unreliable, the
          <link linkend="check-mbox-size">$check_mbox_size</link> option can be
          used to make NeoMutt track and consult file sizes for new mail
          detection instead which won't work for size-neutral changes.
        </para>
        <para>
          New mail for Maildir is assumed if there is one message in the
          <literal>new/</literal> subdirectory which is not marked deleted (see
          <link linkend="maildir-trash">$maildir_trash</link>). For MH folders,
          a mailbox is considered having new mail if there's at least one
          message in the <quote>unseen</quote> sequence as specified by
          <link linkend="mh-seq-unseen">$mh_seq_unseen</link>. Optionally,
          <link linkend="new-mail-command">$new_mail_command</link> can be
          configured to execute an external program every time new mail is
          detected in the current inbox.
        </para>
        <para>
          NeoMutt does not poll POP3 folders for new mail, it only periodically
          checks the currently opened folder (if it's a POP3 folder).
        </para>
        <para>
          For IMAP, by default NeoMutt uses recent message counts provided by
          the server to detect new mail. If the
          <link linkend="imap-idle">$imap_idle</link> option is set, it'll use
          the IMAP IDLE extension if advertised by the server.

        <para>
          The <link linkend="mail-check-recent">$mail_check_recent</link>

          you of new mail received since the last time you opened the mailbox.
          When unset, NeoMutt will notify you of any new mail in the mailbox.

          folder type: for local/IMAP folders it consults
          <link linkend="mail-check">$mail_check</link> and
          <link linkend="pop-checkinterval">$pop_checkinterval</link> for POP

    <title>NeoMutt's MIME Support</title>
    <para>
      Quite a bit of effort has been made to make NeoMutt the premier text-mode
      MIME MUA. Every effort has been made to provide the functionality that
      the discerning MIME user requires, and the conformance to the standards
      wherever possible. When configuring NeoMutt for MIME, there are two extra
      types of configuration files which NeoMutt uses. One is the
      <literal>mime.types</literal> file, which contains the mapping of file
      extensions to IANA MIME types. The other is the
      <literal>mailcap</literal> file, which specifies the external commands to
      use for handling specific MIME types.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="using-mime">
      <title>Using MIME in NeoMutt</title>

      <sect2 id="mime-overview">
        <title>MIME Overview</title>
        <para>
          MIME is short for <quote>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension</quote>
          and describes mechanisms to internationalize and structure mail
          messages. Before the introduction of MIME, messages had a single text
          part and were limited to us-ascii header and content. With MIME,
          messages can have attachments (and even attachments which itself have
          attachments and thus form a tree structure), nearly arbitrary
          characters can be used for sender names, recipients and subjects.
        </para>
        <para>
          Besides the handling of non-ascii characters in message headers, to
          NeoMutt the most important aspect of MIME are so-called MIME types.
          These are constructed using a <emphasis>major</emphasis> and
          <emphasis>minor</emphasis> type separated by a forward slash. These
          specify details about the content that follows. Based upon these,
          NeoMutt decides how to handle this part. The most popular major type
          is <quote><literal>text</literal></quote> with minor types for
          plain text, HTML and various other formats. Major types also exist
          for images, audio, video and of course general application data (e.g.
          to separate cryptographically signed data with a signature, send
          office documents, and in general arbitrary binary data). There's also
          the <literal>multipart</literal> major type which represents the root
          of a subtree of MIME parts. A list of supported MIME types can be
          found in <xref linkend="supported-mime-types" />.
        </para>
        <para>
          MIME also defines a set of encoding schemes for transporting MIME
          content over the network: <literal>7bit</literal>,
          <literal>8bit</literal>, <literal>quoted-printable</literal>,
          <literal>base64</literal> and <literal>binary</literal>. There're
          some rules when to choose what for encoding headers and/or body (if
          needed), and NeoMutt will in general make a good choice.
        </para>
        <para>
          NeoMutt does most of MIME encoding/decoding behind the scenes to form
          messages conforming to MIME on the sending side. On reception, it can
          be flexibly configured as to how what MIME structure is displayed
          (and if it's displayed): these decisions are based on the content's
          MIME type. There are three areas/menus in dealing with MIME: the
          pager (while viewing a message), the attachment menu and the compose
          menu.

        <para>
          When you select a message from the index and view it in the pager,
          NeoMutt decodes as much of a message as possible to a text
          representation. NeoMutt internally supports a number of MIME types,
          including the <literal>text</literal> major type (with all minor
          types), the <literal>message/rfc822</literal> (mail messages) type
          and some <literal>multipart</literal> types. In addition, it
          recognizes a variety of PGP MIME types, including PGP/MIME and
          <literal>application/pgp</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
          NeoMutt will denote attachments with a couple lines describing them.
          These lines are of the form:

[-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: 10000 --]

          encodings.
        </para>

        <title>The Compose Menu</title>
        <para>
          The compose menu is the menu you see before you send a message. It
          allows you to edit the recipient list, the subject, and other aspects
          of your message. It also contains a list of the attachments of your
          message, including the main body. From this menu, you can print,
          copy, filter, pipe, edit, compose, review, and rename an attachment
          or a list of tagged attachments. You can also modifying the
          attachment information, notably the type, encoding and description.
        </para>
        <para>
          Attachments appear as follows by default:
        </para>

<screen>
- 1 [text/plain, 7bit, 1K]           /tmp/neomutt-euler-8082-0 &lt;no description&gt;

</screen>

        <para>
          The <quote>-</quote> denotes that NeoMutt will delete the file after
          sending (or postponing, or canceling) the message. It can be toggled
          with the <literal>&lt;toggle-unlink&gt;</literal> command (default:
          u). The next field is the MIME content-type, and can be changed with
          the <literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal> command (default: ^T). The
          next field is the encoding for the attachment, which allows a binary
          message to be encoded for transmission on 7bit links. It can be
          changed with the <literal>&lt;edit-encoding&gt;</literal> command
          (default: ^E). The next field is the size of the attachment, rounded
          to kilobytes or megabytes. The next field is the filename, which can
          be changed with the <literal>&lt;rename-file&gt;</literal> command
          (default: R). The final field is the description of the attachment,
          and can be changed with the
          <literal>&lt;edit-description&gt;</literal> command (default: d). See

      <title>MIME Type Configuration with <literal>mime.types</literal></title>
      <para>
        To get most out of MIME, it's important that a MIME part's content type
        matches the content as closely as possible so that the recipient's
        client can automatically select the right viewer for the content.
        However, there's no reliable for NeoMutt to know how to detect every
        possible file type. Instead, it uses a simple plain text mapping file
        that specifies what file extension corresponds to what MIME type. This
        file is called <literal>mime.types</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you add an attachment to your mail message, NeoMutt searches the
        system <literal>mime.types</literal> file at
        <literal>/etc/mime.types</literal>,
        <literal>$SYSCONFDIR/mime.types</literal> or
        <literal>$PKGDATADIR/mime.types</literal> and then your personal
        <literal>mime.types</literal> file at
        <literal>$HOME/.mime.types</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Where <literal>$HOME</literal> is your home directory. The
        <literal>$PKGDATADIR</literal> and the <literal>$SYSCONFDIR</literal>
        directories depend on where NeoMutt is installed: the former is the
        default for shared data, the latter for system configuration files.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each line starts with the full MIME type, followed by a space and
        space-separated list of file extensions. For example you could use:
      </para>
      <example id="ex-mime-types">
        <title><literal>mime.types</literal></title>

<screen>
application/postscript          ps eps
application/pgp                 pgp
audio/x-aiff                    aif aifc aiff
</screen>

      </example>
      <para>
        A sample <literal>mime.types</literal> file comes with the NeoMutt
        distribution, and should contain most of the MIME types you are likely
        to use.
      </para>
      <para>
        If NeoMutt can not determine the MIME type by the extension of the file
        you attach, it will run the command specified in
        <link linkend="mime-type-query-command">$mime_type_query_command</link>.
        If that command is not specified, NeoMutt will look at the file. If the
        file is free of binary information, NeoMutt will assume that the file
        is plain text, and mark it as <literal>text/plain</literal>. If the
        file contains binary information, then NeoMutt will mark it as
        <literal>application/octet-stream</literal>. You can change the MIME
        type that NeoMutt assigns to an attachment by using the
        <literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal> command from the compose menu
        (default: ^T), see <xref linkend="supported-mime-types" /> for
        supported major types. NeoMutt recognizes all of these if the
        appropriate entry is found in the <literal>mime.types</literal> file.
        Non-recognized mime types should only be used if the recipient of the
        message is likely to be expecting such attachments.

      <title>MIME Viewer Configuration with Mailcap</title>
      <para>
        NeoMutt supports RFC1524 MIME Configuration, in particular the Unix
        specific format specified in Appendix A of RFC1524. This file format
        is commonly referred to as the <quote>mailcap</quote> format. Many MIME
        compliant programs utilize the mailcap format, allowing you to specify
        handling for all MIME types in one place for all programs. Programs
        known to use this format include Firefox, lynx and metamail.
      </para>
      <para>
        In order to handle various MIME types that NeoMutt doesn't have
        built-in support for, it parses a series of external configuration
        files to find an external handler. The default search string for these
        files is a colon delimited list containing the following files:

      <sect2 id="mailcap-basics">
        <title>The Basics of the Mailcap File</title>
        <para>
          A mailcap file consists of a series of lines which are comments,
          blank, or definitions.
        </para>
        <para>
          A comment line consists of a # character followed by anything you
          want.
        </para>
        <para>
          A blank line is blank.
        </para>
        <para>
          A definition line consists of a content type, a view command, and any
          number of optional fields. Each field of a definition line is divided
          by a semicolon <quote>;</quote> character.
        </para>
        <para>
          The content type is specified in the MIME standard
          <quote>type/subtype</quote> notation. For example,
          <literal>text/plain</literal>, <literal>text/html</literal>,
          <literal>image/gif</literal>, etc. In addition, the mailcap format
          includes two formats for wildcards, one using the special
          <quote>*</quote> subtype, the other is the implicit wild, where you
          only include the major type. For example, <literal>image/*</literal>,
          or <literal>video</literal> will match all image types and video
          types, respectively.
        </para>
        <para>
          The view command is a Unix command for viewing the type specified.
          There are two different types of commands supported. The default is
          to send the body of the MIME message to the command on stdin. You can
          change this behavior by using <literal>%s</literal> as a parameter to
          your view command. This will cause NeoMutt to save the body of the
          MIME message to a temporary file, and then call the view command with
          the <literal>%s</literal> replaced by the name of the temporary file.
          In both cases, NeoMutt will turn over the terminal to the view
          program until the program quits, at which time NeoMutt will remove
          the temporary file if it exists. This means that mailcap does
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> work out of the box with programs which
          detach themselves from the terminal right after starting, like
          <literal>open</literal> on Mac OS X. In order to nevertheless use
          these programs with mailcap, you probably need custom shell scripts.
        </para>
        <para>
          So, in the simplest form, you can send
          a <literal>text/plain</literal> message to the external pager more on
          standard input:
        </para>
        <screen>text/plain; more</screen>
        <para>
          Or, you could send the message as a file:
        </para>
        <screen>text/plain; more %s</screen>
        <para>
          Perhaps you would like to use lynx to interactively view
          a <literal>text/html</literal> message:
        </para>
        <screen>text/html; lynx %s</screen>
        <para>
          In this case, lynx does not support viewing a file from standard
          input, so you must use the <literal>%s</literal> syntax.
        </para>
        <note>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Some older versions of lynx contain a bug where they will
              check the mailcap file for a viewer for
              <literal>text/html</literal>. They will find the line which calls
              lynx, and run it. This causes lynx to continuously spawn itself
              to view the object.</emphasis>
          </para>
        </note>
        <para>
          On the other hand, maybe you don't want to use lynx interactively,
          you just want to have it convert the <literal>text/html</literal> to
          <literal>text/plain</literal>, then you can use:
        </para>
        <screen>text/html; lynx -dump %s | more</screen>
        <para>
          Perhaps you wish to use lynx to view <literal>text/html</literal>
          files, and a pager on all other text formats, then you would use the
          following:
        </para>

      <sect2 id="secure-mailcap">
        <title>Secure Use of Mailcap</title>
        <para>
          The interpretation of shell meta-characters embedded in MIME
          parameters can lead to security problems in general. NeoMutt tries to
          quote parameters in expansion of <literal>%s</literal> syntaxes
          properly, and avoids risky characters by substituting them, see the
          <link linkend="mailcap-sanitize">$mailcap_sanitize</link> variable.
        </para>
        <para>
          Although NeoMutt's procedures to invoke programs with mailcap seem to
          be safe, there are other applications parsing mailcap, maybe taking
          less care of it. Therefore you should pay attention to the following
          rules:
        </para>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Keep the %-expandos away from shell quoting.</emphasis>
          Don't quote them with single or double quotes. NeoMutt does this for
          you, the right way, as should any other program which interprets
          mailcap. Don't put them into backtick expansions. Be highly careful
          with evil statements, and avoid them if possible at all. Trying to
          fix broken behavior with quotes introduces new leaks – there is no
          alternative to correct quoting in the first place.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you have to use the %-expandos' values in context where you need
          quoting or backtick expansions, put that value into a shell variable
          and reference the shell variable where necessary, as in the following
          example (using <literal>$charset</literal> inside the backtick
          expansion is safe, since it is not itself subject to any further
          expansion):

          <title>Optional Fields</title>
          <para>
            In addition to the required content-type and view command fields,
            you can add semi-colon <quote>;</quote> separated fields to set
            flags and other options. NeoMutt recognizes the following optional
            fields:
          </para>
          <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
              <term>copiousoutput</term>
              <listitem>
                <para>
                  This flag tells NeoMutt that the command passes possibly
                  large amounts of text on standard output. This causes NeoMutt
                  to invoke a pager (either the internal pager or the external
                  pager defined by the pager variable) on the output of the
                  view command. Without this flag, NeoMutt assumes that the
                  command is interactive. One could use this to replace the
                  pipe to <literal>more</literal> in the
                  <literal>lynx -dump</literal> example in the Basic section:

                <screen>text/html; lynx -dump %s ; copiousoutput</screen>
                <para>
                  This will cause lynx to format the
                  <literal>text/html</literal> output as
                  <literal>text/plain</literal> and NeoMutt will use your
                  standard pager to display the results.
                </para>
                <para>
                  NeoMutt will set the <literal>COLUMNS</literal> environment
                  variable to the width of the pager. Some programs make use of
                  this environment variable automatically. Others provide
                  a command line argument that can use this to set the output
                  width:

                  NeoMutt uses this flag when viewing attachments with
                  <link linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link>,
                  in order to decide whether it should honor the setting of the
                  <link linkend="wait-key">$wait_key</link> variable or not.
                  When an attachment is viewed using an interactive program,
                  and the corresponding mailcap entry has
                  a <emphasis>needsterminal</emphasis> flag, NeoMutt will use
                  <link linkend="wait-key">$wait_key</link> and the exit status
                  of the program to decide if it will ask you to press a key
                  after the external program has exited. In all other
                  situations it will not prompt you for a key.

                  This field specifies the format for the file denoted by
                  <literal>%s</literal> in the command fields. Certain programs
                  will require a certain file extension, for instance, to
                  correctly view a file. For instance, lynx will only interpret
                  a file as <literal>text/html</literal> if the file ends in
                  <literal>.html</literal>. So, you would specify lynx as
                  a <literal>text/html</literal> viewer with a line in the
                  mailcap file like:
                </para>
                <screen>text/html; lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html</screen>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>
                  This field specifies a command to run to test whether this
                  mailcap entry should be used. The command is defined with the
                  command expansion rules defined in the next section. If the
                  command returns 0, then the test passed, and NeoMutt uses
                  this entry. If the command returns non-zero, then the test
                  failed, and NeoMutt continues searching for the right entry.
                  Note that the content-type must match before NeoMutt performs
                  the test. For example:
                </para>

<screen>
text/html; firefox -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
text/html; lynx %s
</screen>

                <para>
                  In this example, NeoMutt will run the program
                  <literal>RunningX</literal> which will return 0 if the
                  X Window manager is running, and non-zero if it isn't. If
                  <literal>RunningX</literal> returns 0, then NeoMutt will run
                  firefox to display the <literal>text/html</literal> object.
                  If RunningX doesn't return 0, then NeoMutt will go on to the
                  next entry and use lynx to display the
                  <literal>text/html</literal> object.

          <title>Search Order</title>
          <para>
            When searching for an entry in the mailcap file, NeoMutt will
            search for the most useful entry for its purpose. For instance, if
            you are attempting to print an <literal>image/gif</literal>, and
            you have the following entries in your mailcap file, NeoMutt will
            search for an entry with the print command:
          </para>

<screen>
image/*;        xv %s
image/gif;      ; print=anytopnm %s | pnmtops | lpr; \
                nametemplate=%s.gif
</screen>

          <para>
            NeoMutt will skip the <literal>image/*</literal> entry and use the
            <literal>image/gif</literal> entry with the print command.
          </para>
          <para>
            In addition, you can use this with
            <link linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link> to
            denote two commands for viewing an attachment, one to be viewed
            automatically, the other to be viewed interactively from the
            attachment menu using the <literal>&lt;view-mailcap&gt;</literal>
            function (bound to <quote>m</quote> by default). In addition, you
            can then use the test feature to determine which viewer to use
            interactively depending on your environment.
          </para>

<screen>
text/html;      firefox -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
text/html;      lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html
text/html;      lynx -dump %s; nametemplate=%s.html; copiousoutput
</screen>

          <para>
            For <link linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link>,
            NeoMutt will choose the third entry because of the
            <literal>copiousoutput</literal> tag. For interactive viewing,
            NeoMutt will run the program <literal>RunningX</literal> to
            determine if it should use the first entry. If the program returns
            non-zero, NeoMutt will use the second entry for interactive
            viewing. The last entry is for inline display in the pager and the
            <literal>&lt;view-attach&gt;</literal> function in the attachment
            menu.
          </para>
          <para>
            Entries with the <literal>copiousoutput</literal> tag should always
            be specified as the last one per type. For non-interactive use, the
            last entry will then actually be the first matching one with the
            tag set. For non-interactive use, only
            <literal>copiousoutput</literal>-tagged entries are considered. For
            interactive use, NeoMutt ignores this tag and treats all entries
            equally. Therefore, if not specified last, all following entries
            without this tag would never be considered for
            <literal>&lt;view-attach&gt;</literal> because the
            <literal>copiousoutput</literal> before them matched already.

            to <literal>/bin/sh -c</literal>, it is parsed to expand various
            special parameters with information from NeoMutt. The keywords
            NeoMutt expands are:

                  As seen in the basic mailcap section, this variable is
                  expanded to a filename specified by the calling program. This

                  where the composing program should place the results of
                  composition. In addition, the use of this keyword causes
                  NeoMutt to not pass the body of the message to the
                  view/print/edit program on stdin.

                  NeoMutt will expand this to the value of the specified
                  parameter from the Content-Type: line of the mail message.
                  For instance, if your mail message contains:

                <screen>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1</screen>

        In addition to explicitly telling NeoMutt to view an attachment with
        the MIME viewer defined in the mailcap file from the attachments menu,
        NeoMutt has support for automatically viewing MIME attachments while in
        the pager.
      </para>
      <para>
        For this to work, you must define a viewer in the mailcap file which
        uses the <literal>copiousoutput</literal> option to denote that it is
        non-interactive. Usually, you also use the entry to convert the
        attachment to a text representation which you can view in the pager.
      </para>
      <para>
        You then use the <command>auto_view</command> configuration command to
        list the content-types that you wish to view automatically. For
        instance, if you set it to:
      </para>

<screen>
auto_view text/html application/x-gunzip \
  application/postscript image/gif application/x-tar-gz
</screen>

      <para>
        ...NeoMutt would try to find corresponding entries for rendering
        attachments of these types as text. A corresponding mailcap could look
        like:
      </para>

<screen>
text/html;              lynx -dump %s; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html
image/*;                anytopnm %s | pnmscale -xsize 80 -ysize 50 | ppmtopgm | \

application/postscript; ps2ascii %s; copiousoutput
</screen>

      <para>
        <command>unauto_view</command> can be used to remove previous entries
        from the <command>auto_view</command> list. This can be used with
        <link linkend="message-hook"><command>message-hook</command></link> to
        autoview messages based on size, etc.
        <quote><command>unauto_view</command>&#160;*</quote> will remove all

      <para>
        A <literal>multipart/alternative</literal> email has several
        parts that represent the same content in different formats, such as
        <literal>text/plain</literal> and <literal>text/html</literal>. This
        kind of email is heavily used by many modern mail user agents to send
        HTML messages which contain an alternative plain text representation.
        You can read and write <literal>multipart/alternative</literal> emails
        in NeoMutt.

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              First, NeoMutt will check the <command>alternative_order</command>
              list to determine if one of the available types is preferred. It
              consists of a number of MIME types in order, including support for
              implicit and explicit wildcards. For example:
            </para>

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Next, NeoMutt will check if any of the types have a defined
              <link linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link>, and
              use that.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>

      <title>Attachment Searching and Counting</title>
      <para>
        If you ever lose track of attachments in your mailboxes, NeoMutt's
        attachment-counting and -searching support might be for you. You can
        make your message index display the number of qualifying attachments in
        each message, or search for messages by attachment count. You also can
        configure what kinds of attachments qualify for this feature with the
        <command>attachments</command> and <command>unattachments</command>
        commands.
      </para>
      <para>
        In order to provide this information, NeoMutt needs to fully MIME-parse
        all messages affected first. This can slow down operation especially
        for remote mail folders such as IMAP because all messages have to be
        downloaded first regardless whether the user really wants to view them
        or not though using <xref linkend="body-caching" /> usually means to
        download the message just once.

      <para>
        <emphasis>disposition</emphasis> is the attachment's
        Content-Disposition type – either <literal>inline</literal> or

        <literal>I</literal> or <literal>A</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Disposition is prefixed by either a <quote>+</quote> symbol or
        a <quote>-</quote> symbol. If it's a <quote>+</quote>, you're saying
        that you want to allow this disposition and MIME type to qualify. If
        it's a <quote>-</quote>, you're saying that this disposition and MIME
        type is an exception to previous <quote>+</quote> rules. There are
        examples below of how this is useful.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>mime-type</emphasis> is the MIME type of the attachment you
        want the command to affect. A MIME type is always of the format
        <literal>major/minor</literal>, where <literal>major</literal>
        describes the broad category of document you're looking at, and
        <literal>minor</literal> describes the specific type within that
        category. The major part of mime-type must be literal text (or the
        special token <quote><literal>*</literal></quote>), but the minor
        part may be a regular expression. (Therefore,
        <quote><literal>*/.*</literal></quote> matches any MIME type.)
      </para>
      <para>
        The MIME types you give to the <command>attachments</command> directive
        are a kind of pattern. When you use the <command>attachments</command>
        directive, the patterns you specify are added to a list. When you use
        <command>unattachments</command>, the pattern is removed from the list.
        The patterns are not expanded and matched to specific MIME types at
        this time – they're just text in a list. They're only matched when
        actually evaluating a message.
      </para>

        <para>
          NeoMutt optionally supports the IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocols which
          require to access servers using URLs. The canonical syntax for
          specifying URLs in NeoMutt is (an item enclosed in
          <literal>[]</literal> means it is optional and may be omitted):
        </para>
        <screen>proto[s]://[username[:password]@]server[:port][/path]</screen>
        <para>
          <emphasis>proto</emphasis> is the communication protocol:
          <literal>imap</literal> for IMAP, <literal>pop</literal> for POP3 and
          <literal>smtp</literal> for SMTP. If <quote>s</quote> for
          <quote>secure communication</quote> is appended, NeoMutt will attempt
          to establish an encrypted communication using SSL or TLS.
        </para>
        <para>
          Since all protocols supported by NeoMutt support/require
          authentication, login credentials may be specified in the URL. This
          has the advantage that multiple IMAP, POP3 or SMTP servers may be
          specified (which isn't possible using, for example,
          <link linkend="imap-user">$imap_user</link>). The username may contain
          the <quote>@</quote> symbol being used by many mail systems as part
          of the login name. The special characters <quote>/</quote>
          (<literal>%2F</literal>), <quote>:</quote> (<literal>%3A</literal>)
          and <quote>%</quote> (<literal>%25</literal>) have to be URL-encoded
          in usernames using the <literal>%</literal>-notation.
        </para>
        <para>
          A password can be given, too but is not recommended if the URL is
          specified in a configuration file on disk.
        </para>
        <para>
          If no port number is given, NeoMutt will use the system's default for
          the given protocol (usually consulting
          <literal>/etc/services</literal>).

        If NeoMutt is compiled with IMAP, POP3 and/or SMTP support, it can also

    <sect1 id="pop">
      <title>POP3 Support</title>
      <para>
        NeoMutt has POP3 support and has the ability to work with mailboxes
        located on a remote POP3 server and fetch mail for local browsing.
      </para>
      <para>
        Remote POP3 servers can be accessed using URLs with the
        <literal>pop</literal> protocol for unencrypted and
        <literal>pops</literal> for encrypted communication, see
        <xref linkend="url-syntax" /> for details.
      </para>
      <para>
        Polling for new mail is more expensive over POP3 than locally. For this
        reason the frequency at which NeoMutt will check for mail remotely can
        be controlled by the
        <link linkend="pop-checkinterval">$pop_checkinterval</link> variable,
        which defaults to every 60 seconds.
      </para>
      <para>
        POP is read-only which doesn't allow for some features like editing
        messages or changing flags. However, using
        <xref linkend="header-caching" /> and <xref linkend="body-caching" />
        NeoMutt simulates the new/old/read flags as well as flagged and
        replied. NeoMutt applies some logic on top of remote messages but
        cannot change them so that modifications of flags are lost when
        messages are downloaded from the POP server (either by NeoMutt or other
        tools).
      </para>
      <anchor id="fetch-mail" />
      <para>
        Another way to access your POP3 mail is the
        <literal>&lt;fetch-mail&gt;</literal> function (default: G). It allows
        to connect to <link linkend="pop-host">$pop_host</link>, fetch all your
        new mail and place it in the local
        <link linkend="spoolfile">$spoolfile</link>. After this point, NeoMutt
        runs exactly as if the mail had always been local.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          If you only need to fetch all messages to a local mailbox you should
          consider using a specialized program, such as
          <literal>fetchmail(1)</literal>, <literal>getmail(1)</literal> or
          similar.

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="imap">
      <title>IMAP Support</title>
      <para>
        NeoMutt has IMAP support and has the ability to work with folders
        located on a remote IMAP server.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can access the remote inbox by selecting the folder by its URL (see
        <xref linkend="url-syntax" /> for details) using the
        <literal>imap</literal> or <literal>imaps</literal> protocol.
        Alternatively, a pine-compatible notation is also supported, i.e.
        <literal>{[username@]imapserver[:port][/ssl]}path/to/folder</literal>
      </para>
      <para>
        Note that not all servers use <quote>/</quote> as the hierarchy
        separator. NeoMutt should correctly notice which separator is being
        used by the server and convert paths accordingly.
      </para>
      <para>
        When browsing folders on an IMAP server, you can toggle whether to look
        at only the folders you are subscribed to, or all folders with the
        <emphasis>toggle-subscribed</emphasis> command. See also the
        <link linkend="imap-list-subscribed">$imap_list_subscribed</link>
        variable.
      </para>
      <para>
        Polling for new mail on an IMAP server can cause noticeable delays.
        So, you'll want to carefully tune the
        <link linkend="mail-check">$mail_check</link> and
        <link linkend="timeout">$timeout</link> variables. Reasonable values
        are:
      </para>

        with relatively good results even over slow modem lines.

        <para>
          Note that if you are using mbox as the mail store on UW servers prior
          to v12.250, the server has been reported to disconnect a client if
          another client selects the same folder.

              <quote>+</quote>, indicating that the entry contains both
              messages and subfolders. On Cyrus-like servers folders will often
              contain both messages and subfolders.  A mailbox name with a

        <para>
          NeoMutt supports four authentication methods with IMAP servers: SASL,
          GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, and LOGIN. There is also support for the
          pseudo-protocol ANONYMOUS, which allows you to log in to a public
          IMAP server without having an account. To use ANONYMOUS, simply make
          your username blank or <quote>anonymous</quote>.
        </para>
        <para>
          SASL is a special super-authenticator, which selects among several
          protocols (including GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, ANONYMOUS, and DIGEST-MD5) the
          most secure method available on your host and the server. Using some
          of these methods (including DIGEST-MD5 and possibly GSSAPI), your
          entire session will be encrypted and invisible to those teeming
          network snoops. It is the best option if you have it. To use it, you
          must have the Cyrus SASL library installed on your system and compile
          NeoMutt with the <emphasis>--with-sasl</emphasis> flag.

        is invoked whenever NeoMutt needs to access a remote mailbox (including
        inside the folder browser), not just when you open the mailbox. This
        includes (for example) polling for new mail, storing Fcc messages and
        saving messages to a folder. As a consequence,
        <link linkend="account-hook"><command>account-hook</command></link>
        should only be used to set connection-related settings such as
        passwords or tunnel commands but not settings such as sender address or
        name (because in general it should be considered unpredictable which
        <link linkend="account-hook"><command>account-hook</command></link> was
        last used).

        NeoMutt polls them for new mail. Each
        <link linkend="folder-hook"><command>folder-hook</command></link>
        triggers when one mailbox below each IMAP account is opened and sets
        <link linkend="folder">$folder</link> to the account's root folder.
        Next, it sets
        <link linkend="record">$record</link> to the
        <emphasis>INBOX/Sent</emphasis> folder below the newly set
        <link linkend="folder">$folder</link>. Please notice that the value the
        <quote>+</quote> <link linkend="shortcuts">mailbox shortcut</link>
        refers to depends on the <emphasis>current</emphasis> value of
        <link linkend="folder">$folder</link> and therefore has to be set
        separately per account. Setting other values like
        <link linkend="from">$from</link> or
        <link linkend="signature">$signature</link> is analogous to setting
        <link linkend="record">$record</link>.

    <sect1 id="caching">
      <title>Local Caching</title>
      <para>
        NeoMutt contains two types of local caching: <emphasis>(1)</emphasis>
        the so-called <quote>header caching</quote> and
        <emphasis>(2)</emphasis> the so-called <quote>body caching</quote>
        which are both described in this section.
      </para>
      <para>
        Header caching is optional as it depends on external libraries, body
        caching is always enabled if NeoMutt is compiled with POP and/or IMAP
        support as these use it (body caching requires no external library).
      </para>

      <sect2 id="header-caching">
        <title>Header Caching</title>
        <para>
          NeoMutt provides optional support for caching message headers for the
          following types of folders: IMAP, POP, Maildir and MH. Header caching
          greatly speeds up opening large folders because for remote folders,
          headers usually only need to be downloaded once. For Maildir and MH,
          reading the headers from a single file is much faster than looking at
          possibly thousands of single files (since Maildir and MH use one file
          per message.)
        </para>
        <para>
          Header caching can be enabled by configuring one of the database
          backends. One of bdb, gdbm, kyotocabinet, lmdb, qdbm, rocksdb, tdb,
          tokyocabinet.
        </para>
        <para>
          If enabled, <link linkend="header-cache">$header_cache</link> can be
          used to either point to a file or a directory. If set to point to
          a file, one database file for all folders will be used (which may
          result in lower performance), but one file per folder if it points to
          a directory.
        </para>
        <para>
          Additionally,
          <link linkend="header-cache-backend">$header_cache_backend</link> must
          be set to specify which backend to use. The list of available
          backends can be specified at configure time with a set of
          --with-&lt;backend&gt; options. Currently, the following backends are
          supported: bdb, gdbm, kyotocabinet, lmdb, qdbm, rocksdb, tdb,
          tokyocabinet.
        </para>
         <para>
          Take a look at the benchmark script provided in the following directory:
          <ulink url="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/master/contrib/hcache-bench">contrib/hcache-bench</ulink>
          of the neomutt sources, there you can find a way of finding the
          storage backend for your needs.

      <sect2 id="body-caching">
        <title>Body Caching</title>
        <para>
          Both cache methods can be combined using the same directory for
          storage (and for IMAP/POP even provide meaningful file names) which
          simplifies manual maintenance tasks.
        </para>
        <para>
          In addition to caching message headers only, NeoMutt can also cache
          whole message bodies. This results in faster display of messages for
          POP and IMAP folders because messages usually have to be downloaded
          only once.
        </para>
        <para>
          For configuration, the variable
          <link linkend="message-cachedir">$message_cachedir</link> must point
          to a directory. There, NeoMutt will create a hierarchy of
          subdirectories named like the account and mailbox path the cache is

        <para>
          In a header or body cache directory, NeoMutt creates a directory
          hierarchy named like: <literal>proto:user@hostname</literal> where
          <literal>proto</literal> is either <quote>pop</quote> or
          <quote>imap.</quote> Within there, for each folder, NeoMutt stores
          messages in single files and header caches in files with the
          <quote>.hcache</quote> extension. All files can be removed as needed
          if the consumed disk space becomes an issue as NeoMutt will silently
          fetch missing items again. Pathnames are always stored in UTF-8
          encoding.
        </para>
        <para>
          For Maildir and MH, the header cache files are named after the MD5

        <para>
          NeoMutt does not (yet) support maintenance features for header cache
          database files so that files have to be removed in case they grow too
          big. It depends on the database library used for header caching
          whether disk space freed by removing messages is re-used.
        </para>
        <para>
          For body caches, NeoMutt can keep the local cache in sync with the
          remote mailbox if the
          <link linkend="message-cache-clean">$message_cache_clean</link>
          variable is set. Cleaning means to remove messages from the cache
          which are no longer present in the mailbox which only happens when
          other mail clients or instances of NeoMutt using a different body
          cache location delete messages (NeoMutt itself removes deleted
          messages from the cache when syncing a mailbox). As cleaning can take
          a noticeable amount of time, it should not be set in general but only
          occasionally.

      <title>Sending Anonymous Messages via Mixmaster</title>
      <para>
        You may also have compiled NeoMutt to co-operate with Mixmaster, an
        anonymous remailer. Mixmaster permits you to send your messages
        anonymously using a chain of remailers. Mixmaster support in NeoMutt is
        for mixmaster version 2.04 or later.
      </para>
      <para>
        To use it, you'll have to obey certain restrictions. Most important,
        you cannot use the <literal>Cc</literal> and <literal>Bcc</literal>
        headers. To tell NeoMutt to use mixmaster, you have to select
        a remailer chain, using the mix function on the compose menu.
      </para>
      <para>
        The chain selection screen is divided into two parts. In the (larger)
        upper part, you get a list of remailers you may use. In the lower part,
        you see the currently selected chain of remailers.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can navigate in the chain using the
        <literal>&lt;chain-prev&gt;</literal> and
        <literal>&lt;chain-next&gt;</literal> functions, which are by default
        bound to the left and right arrows and to the <literal>h</literal> and
        <literal>l</literal> keys (think vi keyboard bindings). To insert
        a remailer at the current chain position, use the
        <literal>&lt;insert&gt;</literal> function. To append a remailer behind
        the current chain position, use <literal>&lt;select-entry&gt;</literal>
        or <literal>&lt;append&gt;</literal>. You can also delete entries from
        the chain, using the corresponding function. Finally, to abandon your
        changes, leave the menu, or <literal>&lt;accept&gt;</literal> them
        pressing (by default) the <literal>Return</literal> key.
      </para>
      <para>
        Note that different remailers do have different capabilities, indicated
        in the %c entry of the remailer menu lines (see
        <link linkend="mix-entry-format">$mix_entry_format</link>). Most
        important is the <quote>middleman</quote> capability, indicated by
        a capital <quote>M</quote>: This means that the remailer in question
        cannot be used as the final element of a chain, but will only forward
        messages to other mixmaster remailers. For details on the other
        capabilities, please have a look at the mixmaster documentation.

          The Compressed Folder feature allows NeoMutt to read mailbox files
          that are compressed. But it isn't limited to compressed files. It
          works well with encrypted files, too. In fact, if you can create

          read it.

          The shell-command must contain two placeholders for filenames:
          <literal>%f</literal> and <literal>%t</literal>. These represent
          <quote>from</quote> and <quote>to</quote> filenames. These
          placeholders should be placed inside single-quotes to prevent
          unintended shell expansions.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you need the exact string <quote>%f</quote> or <quote>%t</quote>
          in your command, simply double up the <quote>%</quote> character,
          e.g. <quote>%%f</quote> or <quote>%%t</quote>.

        <para>
          NeoMutt's format strings can contain embedded if-then-else
          conditions. They are of the form:
        </para>
        <screen>%?VAR?TRUE&amp;FALSE?</screen>
        <para>
          If the variable <quote>VAR</quote> has a value greater than zero,
          print the <quote>TRUE</quote> string, otherwise print the
          <quote>FALSE</quote> string.
        </para>
        <para>
          e.g. <literal>%?S?Size: %S&amp;Empty?</literal>
        </para>
        <para>
          Which can be read as:
        </para>
        <literallayout>if (%S &gt; 0) { print "Size: %S" } else { print "Empty" }</literallayout>
        <para>
          These conditions are useful, but in NeoMutt they cannot be nested
          within one another. This feature uses the notation
          <literal>%&lt;VAR?TRUE&amp;FALSE&gt;</literal> and allows them to be
          nested.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <literal>%&lt;...&gt;</literal> notation was used to format the
          current local time. but that's not really very useful since NeoMutt
          has no means of refreshing the screen periodically.
        </para>
        <para>
          A simple nested condition might be: (Some whitespace has been
          introduced for clarity)

          The command string can contain expandos, such as

            When the notification is sent, the folder of the new mail is no
            longer known. This is a limitation of NeoMutt. The `%f` expando
            will show the open folder.

        <para>
          NeoMutt can read from a news server using NNTP.
        </para>
        <para>
          The default news server can be obtained from the
          <literal>$NNTPSERVER</literal> environment variable or from the
          <literal>/etc/nntpserver</literal> file. Like in other news readers,
          information about the subscribed newsgroups is saved in the file
          specified by the <link linkend="newsrc">$newsrc</link> variable. You
          can open a newsgroup with the function
          <literal>&lt;change-newsgroup&gt;</literal>
        </para>
        <para>
          The variable <link linkend="news-cache-dir">$news_cache_dir</link>
          can be used to point to a directory. NeoMutt will create a hierarchy
          of subdirectories named like the account and newsgroup the cache is
          for. The hierarchy is also used to store header cache if NeoMutt was
          compiled with <link linkend="header-caching">header cache</link>
          support.

            Some backends allow to index and tags mail without storing the tags
            within the mail envelope. Two backends are currently implementing
            this feature. Notmuch handles them natively and IMAP stores them in
            custom IMAP keywords.

      <title>Autocrypt</title>

      <para>
        NeoMutt can be compiled with Autocrypt support by running
        <literal>configure</literal> with the
        <literal>--autocrypt</literal> flag.  Autocrypt provides
        easy to use, passive protection against data collection.  Keys are
        distributed via an <literal>Autocrypt:</literal> header added to
        emails.  It does <emphasis>not</emphasis> protect against active
        adversaries, and so should not be considered a substitute for
        normal encryption via your keyring, using key signing and the web
        of trust to verify identities.  With an understanding of these
        limitations, Autocrypt still provides an easy way to minimize
        cleartext emails sent between common correspondents, without
        having to explicitly exchange keys.  More information can be found
        at <ulink url="https://autocrypt.org/">https://autocrypt.org/</ulink>.
      </para>

      <sect2 id="autocryptdoc-requirements">
        <title>Requirements</title>
        <para>
          Autocrypt requires support for ECC cryptography, and NeoMutt by
          default will generate ECC keys.  Therefore GnuPG 2.1 or greater
          is required.  Additionally, NeoMutt's Autocrypt implementation uses
          GPGME and requires at least version 1.8.0.
        </para>
        <para>
          Account and peer information is stored in a sqlite3 database, and
          so NeoMutt must be configured with the <literal>--with-sqlite</literal>
          flag when autocrypt is enabled.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is highly recommended that NeoMutt be configured
          <literal>--with-idn</literal> or
          <literal>--with-idn2</literal> so that Autocrypt can properly
          deal with international domain names.
        </para>
        <para>
          While NeoMutt uses GPGME for Autocrypt, normal keyring operations
          can still be performed via classic mode (i.e. with
          <link linkend="crypt-use-gpgme">$crypt_use_gpgme</link> unset).
          However, to avoid unnecessary prompts, it is recommended gpg not
          be configured in <literal>loopback pinentry</literal> mode, and
          that <link linkend="pgp-use-gpg-agent">$pgp_use_gpg_agent</link>
          remain set (the default).
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="autocryptdoc-init">
        <title>First Run</title>
        <para>
          To enable Autocrypt, set <link
          linkend="autocrypt">$autocrypt</link>, and if desired change the
          value of <link linkend="autocrypt-dir">$autocrypt_dir</link> in
          your muttrc.  The first time NeoMutt is run after that, you will be
          prompted to create
          <link linkend="autocrypt-dir">$autocrypt_dir</link>.  NeoMutt will then
          automatically create an sqlite3 database and GPG keyring in that
          directory.  Note since these files should be considered private,
          NeoMutt will create this directory with mode
          <literal>700</literal>.  If you create the directory manually,
          you should do the same.
        </para>
        <para>
          NeoMutt recommends keeping the <link
          linkend="autocrypt-dir">$autocrypt_dir</link> directory set
          differently from your GnuPG keyring directory
          (e.g. <literal>~/.gnupg</literal>).  Keys are automatically
          imported into the keyring from <literal>Autocrypt:</literal>
          headers.  Compared to standard <quote>web of trust</quote> keys,
          Autocrypt keys are somewhat ephemeral, and the autocrypt
          database is used to track when keys change or fall out of use.
          Having these keys mixed in with your normal keyring will make it
          more difficult to use features such as
          <link linkend="crypt-opportunistic-encrypt">$crypt_opportunistic_encrypt</link>
          and Autocrypt at the same time.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <link linkend="autocrypt-dir">$autocrypt_dir</link> variable
          is not designed to be changed while NeoMutt is running.  The
          database is created (if necessary) and connected to during
          startup.  Changing the variable can result in a situation where
          NeoMutt is looking in one place for the database and a different
          place for the GPG keyring, resulting in strange behavior.
        </para>
        <para>
          Once the directory, keyring, and database are created, NeoMutt will
          ask whether you would like to create an account.  In order to
          use Autocrypt, each sending address needs an account.  As a
          convenience you can create an account during the first run.  If
          you would like to add additional accounts later, this can be
          done via the <literal>&lt;autocrypt-acct-menu&gt;</literal>
          function in the index, by default bound to <literal>A</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
          Account creation will first ask you for an email address.  Next,
          it will ask whether you want to create a new key or select an
          existing key.  (Note key selection takes place from the <link
          linkend="autocrypt-dir">$autocrypt_dir</link> keyring, which
          will normally be empty during first run).  Finally, it will ask
          whether this address should prefer encryption or not.  Autocrypt
          1.1 allows automatically enabling encryption if
          <emphasis>both</emphasis> sender and receiver have set
          <quote>prefer encryption</quote>.  Otherwise, you will need to
          manually enable autocrypt encryption in the compose menu.  For
          more details, see the compose menu section below.
        </para>
        <para>
          After optionally creating an account, NeoMutt will prompt you to
          scan mailboxes for Autocrypt headers.  This step occurs because
          header cached messages are not re-scanned for Autocrypt headers.
          Scanning during this step will temporarily disable the header
          cache while opening each mailbox.  If you wish to do this
          manually later, you can simulate the same thing by unsetting
          <link linkend="header-cache">$header_cache</link> and opening a
          mailbox.
        </para>
        <para>
          A final technical note: the first run process takes place
          between reading the muttrc and opening the initial mailbox.
          Some muttrc files will <link linkend="push">push</link> macros
          to be run after opening the mailbox.  To prevent this from
          interfering with the first run prompts, NeoMutt disables all macros
          during the first run.

        <title>Alternative Key and Keyring Strategies</title>
        <para>
          NeoMutt by default partitions Autocrypt from normal keyring
          encryption/signing.  It does this by using a separate GPG
          keyring (in <link linkend="autocrypt-dir">$autocrypt_dir</link>)
          and creating a new ECC key in that keyring for accounts.  There
          are good reasons for doing this by default.  It keeps random
          keys found inside email headers out of your normal keyring.  ECC
          keys are compact and better suited for email headers.  Autocrypt
          key selection is completely different from <quote>web of
          trust</quote> key selection, based on last-seen rules as opposed
          to trust and validity.  It also allows NeoMutt to distinguish
          Autocrypt encrypted emails from regular encrypted emails, and
          set the mode appropriately when replying to each type of email.
        </para>
        <para>
          Still, some users may want to use an existing key from their
          normal keyring for Autocrypt too.  There are two ways this can
          be accomplished.  The <emphasis>recommended</emphasis> way is to
          set <link linkend="autocrypt-dir">$autocrypt_dir</link> to your
          normal keyring directory (e.g. <literal>~/.gnupg</literal>).
          During account creation, choosing <quote>(s)elect existing GPG
          key</quote> will then list and allow selecting your existing key
          for the new account.
        </para>
        <para>
          An alternative is to copy your key over to the Autocrypt keyring,
          but there is a severe downside.  NeoMutt <emphasis>first</emphasis>
          tries to decrypt messages using the Autocrypt keyring, and if
          that fails tries the normal keyring second.  This means all
          encrypted emails to that key will be decrypted, and have
          signatures verified from, the Autocrypt keyring.  Keys signatures
          and web of trust from your normal keyring will no longer show up
          in signatures when decrypting.
        </para>
        <para>
          For that reason, if you want to use an existing key from your
          normal keyring, it is recommended to just set <link
          linkend="autocrypt-dir">$autocrypt_dir</link> to
          <literal>~/.gnupg</literal>.  This allows <quote>web of
          trust</quote> to show an appropriate signature message for
          verified messages.  Autocrypt header keys will be imported into
          your keyring, but if you don't want them mixed you should
          strongly consider using a separate autocrypt key and keyring
          instead.
        </para>
        <para>
          Both methods have a couple additional caveats:

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Replying to an Autocrypt decrypted message by default forces
              Autocrypt mode on.  By sharing the same key, all replies
              will then start in Autocrypt mode, even if a message wasn't
              sent by one of your Autocrypt peers.  <link
              linkend="autocrypt-reply">$autocrypt_reply</link> can be
              <emphasis>unset</emphasis> to allow manual control of the

              When NeoMutt creates an account from a GPG key, it exports the
              public key, base64 encodes it, and stores that value in the
              sqlite3 database.  The value is then used in the Autocrypt
              header added to outgoing emails.  The ECC keys NeoMutt creates
              don't change, but if you use external keys that expire, when
              you resign to extend the expiration you will need to
              recreate the Autocrypt account using the <link
              linkend="autocryptdoc-acctmgmt">account menu</link>.
              Otherwise the Autocrypt header will contain the old expired

        These settings work on a per-message basis. However, as messages may
        greatly differ in size and certain operations are much faster than
        others, even per-folder settings of the increment variables may not be
        desirable as they produce either too few or too much progress updates.
        Thus, NeoMutt allows to limit the number of progress updates per second
        it'll actually send to the terminal using the
        <link linkend="time-inc">$time_inc</link> variable.

      <title>Reading Messages from Remote Folders</title>
      <para>
        Reading messages from remote folders such as IMAP an POP can be slow
        especially for large mailboxes since NeoMutt only caches a very limited
        number of recently viewed messages (usually 10) per session (so that it
        will be gone for the next session.)
      </para>
      <para>
        To improve performance and permanently cache whole messages and
        headers, please refer to <link linkend="body-caching">body caching</link>
        and <link linkend="header-caching">header caching</link> for details.
      </para>
      <para>
        Additionally, it may be worth trying some of NeoMutt's experimental
        features.  <link linkend="imap-qresync">$imap_qresync</link> (which
        requires header caching) can provide a huge speed boost opening
        mailboxes if your IMAP server supports it.
        <link linkend="imap-deflate">$imap_deflate</link> enables compression,
        which can also noticeably reduce download time for large mailboxes and
        messages.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="tuning-search">
      <title>Searching and Limiting</title>
      <para>
        When searching mailboxes either via a search or a limit action, for
        some patterns NeoMutt distinguishes between regular expression and
        string searches. For regular expressions, patterns are prefixed with
        <quote>~</quote> and with <quote>=</quote> for string searches.
      </para>
      <para>
        Even though a regular expression search is fast, it's several times
        slower than a pure string search which is noticeable especially on
        large folders. As a consequence, a string search should be used instead
        of a regular expression search if the user already knows enough about
        the search pattern.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, when limiting a large folder to all messages sent to or by
        an author, it's much faster to search for the initial part of an e-mail
        address via <literal>=Luser@</literal> instead of
        <literal>~Luser@</literal>. This is especially true for searching
        message bodies since a larger amount of input has to be searched.
      </para>
      <para>
        As for regular expressions, a lower case string search pattern makes
        NeoMutt perform a case-insensitive search except for IMAP (because for
        IMAP NeoMutt performs server-side searches which don't support
        case-insensitivity).

      </para>
      <para>
        An include file passed with <literal>-i</literal> will be used as the

      <para>
        A draft file passed with <literal>-H</literal> will be used as the

        as a draft file. When combined with <literal>-E</literal>, the draft
        file will be updated to the final state of the message after
        composition, regardless of whether the message is sent, aborted, or
        even postponed. Note that if the message is sent encrypted or signed,
        the draft file will be saved that way too.

        In addition to accepting a list of email addresses, NeoMutt also
        accepts a URL with the <literal>mailto:</literal> schema as specified
        in RFC2368. This is useful when configuring a web browser to launch
        NeoMutt when clicking on mailto links.

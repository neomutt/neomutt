** "Soft-fill" deserves some explanation: Normal right-justification
** will print everything to the left of the "%>", displaying padding and
** whatever lies to the right only if there's room. By contrast,
** soft-fill gives priority to the right-hand side, guaranteeing space
** to display it and showing padding only if there's still room. If
** necessary, soft-fill will eat text leftwards to make room for
** rightward text.

** Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string

** other sequences as well as normal text.
** .pp
** Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
** new messages in a mailbox:
** .pp
** \fC%<n?%n new messages>\fP
** .pp
** You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:
** .pp
** \fC%<sequence_char?if_string&else_string>\fP
** .pp
** If the value of \fIsequence_char\fP is non-zero, \fIif_string\fP will

** are enabled with $$use_threads:
** .pp
** \fC%<T?%s/%S&%T/%s>\fP
** .pp
** You can force the result of any \fCprintf(3)\fP-like sequence to be lowercase
** by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore ("_") sign.

** you would use: "\fC%_h\fP".

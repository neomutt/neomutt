.SH NAME
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
neomuttrc \- Configuration file for the NeoMutt Mail User Agent (MUA)
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.PP
A NeoMutt configuration file consists of a series of \(lqcommands\(rq. Each
line of the file may contain one or more commands. When multiple commands are
used, they must be separated by a semicolon (\(lq\fB;\fP\(rq).
.
.PP
The hash mark, or pound sign (\(lq\fB#\fP\(rq), is used as a \(lqcomment\(rq
character. You can use it to annotate your initialization file. All text after
the comment character to the end of the line is ignored.
.
.PP
Single quotes (\(lq\fB\(aq\fP\(rq) and double quotes (\(lq\fB\(dq\fP\(rq) can
be used to quote strings which contain spaces or other special characters. The
difference between the two types of quotes is similar to that of many popular
shell programs, namely that a single quote is used to specify a literal string
(one that is not interpreted for shell variables or quoting with a backslash
[see next paragraph]), while double quotes indicate a string which should be
evaluated. For example, backticks are evaluated inside of double quotes, but
not single quotes.
.
.PP
\(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq quotes the next character, just as in shells such as Bash
and Zsh. For example, if you want to put quotes (\(lq\fB\(dq\fP\(rq) inside of
a string, you can use \(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq to force the next character to be
a literal instead of interpreted character.
.
.PP
\(lq\fB\(rs\(rs\fP\(rq means to insert a literal \(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq into the
line. \(lq\fB\(rsn\fP\(rq and \(lq\fB\(rsr\fP\(rq have their usual C meanings
of line feed (LF) and carriage return (CR), respectively.
.
.PP
A \(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq at the end of a line can be used to split commands over
multiple lines, provided that the split points don't appear in the middle of
command names.
.
.PP
It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix command in an
initialization file. This is accomplished by enclosing the command in backticks
(\fB\(ga\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB\(ga\fP).
.
.PP
Unix environment variables can be accessed like the way it is done in shells
like sh and Bash: Prepend the name of the variable by a dollar
(\(lq\fB\(Do\fP\(rq) sign.

.PP
The following are the commands understood by NeoMutt:
.
.PP
.nf
\fBaccount-hook\fP \fIregex\fP \fIcommand\fP
.fi
.IP
This hook is executed whenever you access a remote mailbox. Useful to adjust
configuration settings to different IMAP or POP servers.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBalias\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] \fIkey\fP \fIaddress\fP [\fB,\fP \fIaddress\fP ... ]
\fBunalias\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fIkey\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
\fBalias\fP defines a surrogate \fIkey\fP for the given address(es). Each
\fIaddress\fP will be resolved into either an email address
(user@\:example.com) or a named email address (User Name <user@\:example.com>).
The address may be specified in either format, or in the format
\(lquser@\:example.com (User Name)\(rq.
.IP
\fBNote\fP: If you want to create an alias for more than one address, you
\fBmust\fP separate the addresses with a comma (\(lq\fB,\fP\(rq).
.IP
\fBunalias\fP removes the alias corresponding to the given \fIkey\fP or all
aliases when \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq is used as an argument.
.IP
The optional \fB\-group\fP flag causes the address(es) to be added to or
removed from the \fIname\fPd group.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBalternates\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] \fIregex\fP [ \fIregex\fP ... ]
\fBunalternates\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fIregex\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
\fBalternates\fP is used to inform NeoMutt about alternate addresses where you
receive mail; you can use regular expressions (\fIregex\fP) to specify
alternate addresses. This affects NeoMutt's idea about messages from you, and
messages addressed to you.
.IP
\fBunalternates\fP can be used to write exceptions to alternates patterns. To
remove a regular expression from the alternates list, use the unalternates
command with exactly the same \fIregex\fP or use \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq to remove all
entries.
.IP
The optional \fB\-group\fP flag causes all of the subsequent regular expressions
to be added to or removed from the \fIname\fPd group.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBalternative_order\fP \fImime-type\fP[/\fImime-subtype\fP] [ \fImime-type\fP[/\fImime-subtype\fP] ... ]
\fBunalternative_order\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImime-type\fP[/\fImime-subtype\fP] ... }
.fi
.IP
\fBalternative_order\fP command permits you to define an order of preference
that is used by NeoMutt to determine which part of
a \fBmultipart/\:alternative\fP body to display. A \fImime-subtype\fP of
\(lq\fB*\fP\(rq matches any \fBmultipart/\:alternative\fP subtype, as does an
empty \fImime-subtype\fP.
.IP
\fBunalternative_order\fP removes entries from the ordered list or deletes the
entire list when \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq is used as an argument.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBattachments\fP { \fB+\fP | \fB\-\fP }\fIdisposition\fP \fImime-type\fP
\fBunattachments\fP { \fB+\fP | \fB\-\fP }\fIdisposition\fP \fImime-type\fP
.fi
.IP
You can make your message index display the number of qualifying attachments in
each message, or search for messages by attachment count. You also can
configure what kinds of attachments qualify for this feature with the
\fBattachments\fP and \fBunattachments\fP commands.
.IP
\fIdisposition\fP is the attachment's Content-Disposition type \(em either
inline or attachment. You can abbreviate this to \fBI\fP or \fBA\fP.
.IP
\fImime-type\fP is the MIME type of the attachment you want the command to
affect. A MIME type is always of the format \fBmajor/minor\fP. The major part
of \fImime-type\fP must be literal text (or the special token \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq,
but the minor part may be a regular expression. Therefore, \(lq\fB*/.*\fP\(rq
matches any MIME type.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBauto_view\fP \fImime-type\fP[\fB/\fP\fImime-subtype\fP] [ \fImime-type\fP[\fB/\fP\fImime-subtype\fP] ... ]
\fBunauto_view\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImime-type\fP[\fB/\fP\fImime-subtype\fP] ... }
.fi
.IP
This commands permits you to specify that NeoMutt should automatically convert
the given \fImime-type\fPs to text/plain when displaying messages. For this to work,
there must be a
.BR mailcap (5)
entry for the given \fImime-type\fP with the \fBcopiousoutput\fP option set.
A \fImime-subtype\fP of \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq matches any
\fBmultipart/\:alternative\fP subtype, as does an empty \fImime-subtype\fP.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBbind\fP \fImap\fP[\fB,\fP\fImap\fP ... ] \fIkey\fP \fIfunction\fP
\fBunbind\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImap\fP | [\fB,\fP\fImap\fP...]} [ \fIkey\fP ]
.fi
.IP
This command allows you to change the default or define additional key bindings
(operation invoked when pressing a key).
.IP
\fImap\fP specifies in which menu the binding belongs. Multiple \fImap\fPs may
be specified by separating them with commas (no additional whitespace is
allowed). The currently defined \fImap\fPs are:
.BR alias ", " attach ", " browser ", " compose ", " editor ", " generic ", "
.BR index ", " mix ", " pager ", " pgp ", " postpone ", " query " and " smime "."
.IP
\fIkey\fP is the key (or key sequence) you wish to bind, e.g.
\(lq\fB\(rsCa\fP\(rq for control-A. In addition, \fIkey\fP may be specified as
a three digit octal number prefixed with a \(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq or as a symbolic
name. The \fB<what-key>\fP function can be used to explore keycode and
symbolic names for the keys on your keyboard.
.IP
\fIfunction\fP specifies which action to take when key is pressed. Note that
the function name is to be specified without angle brackets.
.IP
Missing key sequence in \fBunbind\fP command means unbind all bindings in menus given in \fImap\fP .
.IP
For more information on keys and functions, please consult the NeoMutt manual.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBcharset-hook\fP \fIalias\fP \fIcharset\fP
\fBiconv-hook\fP \fIcharset\fP \fIlocal-charset\fP
.fi
.IP
\fBcharset-hook\fP defines an \fIalias\fP for a character set. This is useful to
properly display messages which are tagged with a character set name not known
to NeoMutt.
.IP
\fBiconv-hook\fP defines a system-specific name for a character set. This is
useful when your system's
.BR iconv (3)
implementation does not understand MIME character set names (such as
\fBiso-8859-1\fP), but instead insists on being fed with
implementation-specific character set names (such as \fB8859-1\fP). In this
specific case, you'd put \(lq\fBiconv-hook\fP\~iso-8859-1\~8859-1\(rq into your
configuration file.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBcolor\fP \fIobject\fP [ \fIattribute\fP ... ] \fIforeground\fP \fIbackground\fP

\fBuncolor\fP { index-object | header | body } { \fB*\fP | \fIpattern\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
If your terminal supports color, these commands can be used to assign
\fIforeground\fP/\:\fIbackground\fP combinations to certain \fIobject\fPs. The
currently defined \fIobject\fPs are:
.BR attach_\:headers ", "

If the sidebar is enabled the following \fIobject\fPs are also valid:
.BR sidebar_\:divider ", "
.BR sidebar_\:flagged ", "
.BR sidebar_\:highlight ", "
.BR sidebar_\:indicator ", "
.BR sidebar_\:new ", "
.BR sidebar_\:ordinary ", "
.BR sidebar_\:spoolfile "."
.IP
The \fBbody\fP and \fBheader\fP objects allow you to restrict the colorization
to a regular expression. The \fBindex-object\fP permits you to select colored
messages by pattern.
.IP
The \fBheader\fP and \fBbody\fP match \fIregex\fP in the header/body of
a message, \fBindex-object\fP can match \fIpattern\fP in the message index.
Note that IMAP server-side searches (=b, =B, =h) are not supported for color
index patterns.
.IP
Valid composeobjects include
.BR header ", " security_encrypt ", " security_sign ", "
.BR security_both ", " security_none .
.IP
Valid colors include:
.BR default ", "
.BR black ", "
.BR red ", "
.BR green ", "
.BR yellow ", "
.BR blue ", "
.BR magenta ", "
.BR cyan ", "
.BR white ", "
.BR color\fIN\fP "."
.IP
Valid attributes include:
.BR none ", " bold ", " underline ", "
.BR reverse ", and " standout .
IP
The \fBuncolor\fP command can be applied to the index, header and body objects
only. It removes entries from the list. You must specify the same \fIpattern\fP
specified in the \fBcolor\fP command for it to be removed. The pattern
\(lq\fB*\fP\(rq is a special token which means to clear the color list of all
entries.
.IP
For further information on colorization, please consult the NeoMutt manual.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBcrypt-hook\fP \fIregex\fP \fIkeyid\fP
.fi
.IP
The crypt-hook command provides a method by which you can specify the ID of the
public key to be used when encrypting messages to a certain recipient. The
meaning of \fIkeyid\fP is to be taken broadly: This can be a different email
address, a numerical \fIkeyid\fP, or even just an arbitrary search string. You
may use multiple \fBcrypt-hook\fPs with the same \fIregex\fP; multiple matching
\fBcrypt-hook\fPs result in the use of multiple \fIkeyid\fPs for a recipient.
.TP
\fBindex-format-hook\fP \fIname\fP [\fB!\fP]\fIpattern\fP \fIformat-string\fP
This command is used to inject format strings dynamically into
$index_format based on pattern matching against the current message.
.IP
The $index_format expando \fI%@name@\fP specifies a placeholder for
the injection. Index-format-hooks with the same \fIname\fP are matched
using \fIpattern\fP against the current message. Matching is done in
the order specified in the .neomuttrc, with the first match being
used. The hook's \fIformat-string\fP is then substituted and evaluated.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBexec\fP \fIfunction\fP [ \fIfunction\fP ... ]
.fi
.IP
This command can be used to execute any \fIfunction\fP. Functions are listed in
the function reference. \(lq\fBexec\fP \fIfunction\fP\(rq is equivalent to
\(lq\fBpush\fP <\fIfunction\fP>\(rq.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBfcc-save-hook\fP \fIpattern\fP \fImailbox\fP
\fBfcc-hook\fP \fIpattern\fP \fImailbox\fP
\fBsave-hook\fP \fIpattern\fP \fImailbox\fP
.fi
.IP
\fBfcc-save-hook\fP is a shortcut, equivalent to doing both a \fBfcc-hook\fP
and a \fBsave-hook\fP with its arguments, including %-expansion on
\fImailbox\fP according to $index_format.
.IP
\fBfcc-hook\fP is used to save outgoing mail in a mailbox other than $record.
NeoMutt searches the initial list of message recipients for the first matching
\fIpattern\fP and uses \fImailbox\fP as the default \(lqFcc:\(rq mailbox. If no
match is found the message will be saved to $record mailbox.
.IP
\fBsave-hook\fP is used to override the default mailbox used when saving
messages. \fImailbox\fP will be used as the default if the message matches
\fIpattern\fP.
.IP
To provide more flexibility and good defaults, NeoMutt applies the expandos of
$index_format to \fImailbox\fP after it was expanded. See \fIPATTERNS\fP
section below or consult section \(lq\fBMessage Matching in Hooks\fP\(rq in
NeoMutt manual for information on the exact format of \fIpattern\fP.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBfolder-hook\fP \fIregex\fP \fIcommand\fP
.fi
.IP
When NeoMutt enters a folder which matches \fIregex\fP (or, when \fIregex\fP is
preceded by an exclamation mark, does not match \fIregex\fP), the given
\fIcommand\fP is executed.
.IP
When several \fBfolder-hook\fPs match a given mail folder, they are executed in
the order given in the configuration file.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBgroup\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB\-rx\fP \fIexpr\fP ... | \fB\-addr\fP \fIaddress\fP ... }
\fBungroup\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fB\-rx\fP \fIexpr\fP ... | \fB\-addr\fP \fIaddress\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
\fBgroup\fP is used to directly add either addresses or regular expressions to
the specified group or groups. The different categories of arguments to the
\fBgroup\fP command can be in any order. The flags \fB\-rx\fP and \fB\-addr\fP
specify what the following strings (that cannot begin with a hyphen) should be
interpreted as: either a regular expression or an email address, respectively.
.IP
\fBungroup\fP is used to remove addresses or regular expressions from the
specified group or groups. The syntax is similar to the \fBgroup\fP command,
however the special character \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq can be used to empty a group of
all of its contents.
.IP
These address groups can also be created implicitly by the \fBalias\fP,
\fBlists\fP, \fBsubscribe\fP and \fBalternates\fP commands by specifying the
optional \fB\-group\fP option.
.IP
Once defined, these address groups can be used in patterns to search for and
limit the display to messages matching a group.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBhdr_order\fP \fIheader\fP [ \fIheader\fP ... ]
\fBunhdr_order\fP { \fB*\fP | \fIheader\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
With the \fBhdr_order\fP command you can specify an order in which NeoMutt will
attempt to present these headers to you when viewing messages.
.IP
\(lq\fBunhdr_order\~*\fP\(rq will clear all previous headers from the order
list, thus removing the header order effects set by the system-wide startup
file.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBifdef\fP \fIsymbol\fP "\fIconfig-command\fP [ \fIargs\fP ... ]"
\fBifndef\fP \fIsymbol\fP "\fIconfig-command\fP [ \fIargs\fP ... ]"
\fBfinish\fP
.fi
.IP
The \fBifdef\fP feature introduces three new commands to NeoMutt and allow you
to share one config file between versions of NeoMutt that may have different
features compiled in.
.IP
Here a \fIsymbol\fP can be a
.BR $variable ", <" function ">, " command " or " "compile-time symbol" ", "
such as \(lq\fBimap\fP\(rq. A list of compile-time \fIsymbol\fPs can be seen in
the output of the command \(lq\fBneomutt\~\-v\fP\(rq (in the
\(lq\fBCompile options\fP\(rq section).
.IP
\fBfinish\fP is particularly useful when combined with \fBifndef\fP.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBignore\fP \fIpattern\fP [ \fIpattern\fP ... ]
\fBunignore\fP { \fB*\fP | \fIpattern\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
The \fBignore\fP command allows you to specify header fields which you don't
normally want to see in the pager. You do not need to specify the full header
field name. For example, \(lq\fBignore\fP content-\(rq will ignore all header
fields that begin with the pattern \(lqcontent-\(rq, \(lq\fBignore\fP\~*\(rq
will ignore all headers.
.IP
To remove a previously added token from the list, use the \fBunignore\fP
command. For example, \(lq\fBunignore\fP\~*\(rq will remove all tokens from the
ignore list.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBlists\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] \fIregex\fP [ \fIregex\fP ... ]
\fBunlists\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fIregex\fP ... }
\fBsubscribe\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] \fIregex\fP [ \fIregex\fP ... ]
\fBunsubscribe\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fIregex\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
NeoMutt maintains two lists of mailing list address patterns, a list of
subscribed mailing lists, and a list of known mailing lists. All subscribed
mailing lists are known. Patterns use regular expressions.
.IP
The \fBlists\fP command adds a mailing list address to the list of known
mailing lists. The \fBunlists\fP command removes a mailing list from the lists
of known and subscribed mailing lists.
.IP
The \fBsubscribe\fP command adds a mailing list to the lists of known and
subscribed mailing lists. The \fBunsubscribe\fP command removes it from the
list of subscribed mailing lists.
.IP
The \fB\-group\fP flag adds all of the subsequent regular expressions to the
\fIname\fPd group.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBmacro\fP \fImenu\fP[\fB,\fP\fImenu\fP ... ] \fIkey\fP \fIsequence\fP [ \fIdescription\fP ]
\fBunmacro\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImenu\fP | [\fB,\fP\fImenu\fP...]} [ \fIkey\fP ]
.fi
.IP
This command binds the given \fIsequence\fP of keys to the given \fIkey\fP in
the given \fImenu\fP or menus. For currently defined menus, see \fBbind\fP
command above. To specify multiple menus, put only a comma between the menus.
.IP
Optionally you can specify a descriptive text after \fIsequence\fP, which is
shown in the help screens if they contain a \fIdescription\fP.
.IP
Missing key sequence in \fBunmacro\fP command means unmacro all macros in menus given in \fImenu\fP.

.nf
\fBmailboxes\fP \fImailbox\fP [ \fImailbox\fP ... ]
\fBnamed-mailboxes\fP \fIdescription\fP \fImailbox\fP [\fIdescription\fP \fImailbox\fP ... ]
\fBunmailboxes\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImailbox\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
The \fBmailboxes\fP specifies folders which can receive mail and which will be
checked for new messages. When changing folders, pressing space will cycle
through folders with new mail.
.IP
The \fBnamed-mailboxes\fP is an alternative to \fBmailboxes\fP that allows
adding a description for a mailbox. NeoMutt can be configured to display the
description instead of the mailbox path.
.IP
The \fBunmailboxes\fP command is used to remove a file name from the list of
folders which can receive mail. If \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq is specified as the file
name, the list is emptied.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBmailto_allow\fP { \fB*\fP | \fIheader-field\fP ... }
\fBunmailto_allow\fP { \fB*\fP | \fIheader-field\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
As a security measure, NeoMutt will only add user-approved \fIheader-field\fPs
from a \fImailto:\fP URL. This is necessary since NeoMutt will handle certain
\fIheader-field\fPs, such as \fBAttach\fP, in a special way. The
\fBmailto_allow\fP and \fBunmailto_allow\fP commands allow the user to modify
the list of approved headers.
.IP
NeoMutt initializes the default list to contain only the \fBSubject\fP and
\fBBody\fP \fIheader-field\fPs, which are the only requirement specified by the
\fImailto:\fP specification in RFC2368, and the \fBCc\fP, \fBIn-Reply-To\fP,
\fBReferences\fP headers to aid with replies to mailing lists.
.TP
\fBecho\fP \fImessage\fP
Prints \fImessage\fP to the message window. After printing the
message, echo will pause for the number of seconds specified by

.IP
When NeoMutt changes to a mail folder which matches \fIregex\fP, \fImailbox\fP
will be used as the \(lqmbox\(rq folder, i.e. read messages will be moved to
that folder when the mail folder is left.
.IP
Note that execution of \fBmbox-hook\fPs is dependent on the $move configuration
variable. If set to \(lqno\(rq (the default), \fBmbox-hook\fPs will not be
executed.

.IP
This command permits you to define a list of \(lqdata\(rq MIME content types
for which NeoMutt will try to determine the actual file type from the file
name, and not use a
.BR mailcap (5)
entry given for the original MIME type. For instance, you may add the
\fBapplication/\:octet-stream\fP MIME type to this list.

NeoMutt knows four basic types of \fIvariable\fPs: boolean, number, string, string
list and quadoption. Boolean \fIvariable\fPs can be \fBset\fP (true), \fBunset\fP
(false), or \fBtoggle\fPd. Number \fIvariable\fPs can be assigned a positive
integer \fIvalue\fP. Value of number \fIvariable\fPs can be incremented "\fB+=\fP"
and decremented "\fB-=\fP". String list \fIvariable\fPs use "\fB+=\fP" for
appending increment to the string list and "\fB-=\fP" for removal decrement from
the string list.
.IP
String \fIvariable\fPs consist of any number of printable characters and must
be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces or tabs. You may also use the
escape sequences \(lq\fB\(rsn\fP\(rq and \(lq\fB\(rst\fP\(rq for newline and
tab, respectively.
.IP
Quadoption \fIvariable\fPs are used to control whether or not to be prompted
for certain actions, or to specify a default action. A \fIvalue\fP of \fByes\fP
will cause the action to be carried out automatically as if you had answered
\(lqyes\(rq to the question. Similarly, a \fIvalue\fP of \fBno\fP will cause
the action to be carried out as if you had answered \(lqno\(rq.  A \fIvalue\fP
of \fBask-yes\fP will cause a prompt with a default answer of \(lqyes\(rq and
\fBask-no\fP will provide a default answer of \(lqno\(rq.
.IP
The \fBtoggle\fP command automatically prepends the \(lq\fBinv\fP\(rq prefix to
all specified \fIvariable\fPs. The \fBunset\fP command automatically prepends
the \(lq\fBno\fP\(rq prefix to all specified \fIvariable\fPs. If you use the
command \fBset\fP and prefix the \fIvariable\fP with \(lq\fB&\fP\(rq this has
the same behavior as the \fBreset\fP command.

Special attention has to be paid when using regular expressions inside of
patterns. Specifically, NeoMutt's parser for these patterns will strip one
level of backslash (\(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq), which is normally used for quoting. If
it is your intention to use a backslash in the regular expression, you will
need to use two backslashes (\(lq\fB\(rs\(rs\fP\(rq) instead.
.
.PP
You can force NeoMutt to treat \fIEXPR\fP as a simple \fISTRING\fP instead of
a regular expression by using \(lq\fB=\fP\(rq instead of \(lq\fB~\fP\(rq in the
pattern name. For example, \(lq\fB=b\~*.*\fP\(rq will find all messages that
contain the literal \fISTRING\fP \(lq\fB*.*\fP\(rq. Simple substring matches
are less powerful than regular expressions but can be considerably faster. This
is especially true for IMAP folders, because substring matches can be performed
on the server instead of by fetching every message. IMAP treats
\(lq\fB=h\fP\(rq specially: it must be of the form
\(lqHeader:\~\fIsubstring\fP\(rq and will \fBnot\fP partially match header
names. The \fIsubstring\fP part may be omitted if you simply wish to find
messages containing a particular header without regard to its value.

Patterns matching lists of addresses (notably
.BR c ", " C ", " p ", " P " and " t )
match if there is at least one match in the whole list. If you want to make

all messages after the given date will be selected. If you specify a single
date with no dash (\(lq\fB-\fP\(rq), only messages sent/received on the given
date will be selected.

You can add error margins to absolute dates. An error margin is a sign
(\(lq\fB+\fP\(rq or \(lq\fB-\fP\(rq), followed by a digit, followed by one of
the units in table \(lq\fBDate units\fP\(rq below. As a special case, you can
replace the sign by a \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq character, which is equivalent to giving
identical plus and minus error margins.

\fBExample\fP: To select any messages two weeks around January 15, 2001, you'd
use the following pattern:
.
.IP
Limit to messages matching:
.IR \fB~d\fP\~15 / 1 / 2001 \fB*\fP 2 \fBw\fP
.
.PP
It is possible to give multiple error margins:
.
.IP
which cumulate:
.IR \fB~d\fP\~1 / 1 / 2001 \fB-\fP 1 \fBw+\fP 2 \fBw*\fP 3 \fBd\fP

.B Relative Dates
.fi
This type of date is relative to the current date, and may be specified as:
.
.RS
.TP 4
\(bu \(lq\fB<\fP\fIoffset\fP\(rq for messages newer than \fIoffset\fP units
.TQ
\(bu \(lq\fB=\fP\fIoffset\fP\(rq for messages exactly \fIoffset\fP units old
.TQ
\(bu \(lq\fB>\fP\fIoffset\fP\(rq for messages older than \fIoffset\fP units
.RE
.
.PP
\fIoffset\fP is specified as a positive number with one of the units from table
\(lq\fBDate units\fP\(rq.
.
.PP
\fBExample\fP: To select messages less than 1 month old, you would use:
.
.IP
Limit to messages matching:
.BI ~d\~< 1 m
.
.PP
\fBNote\fP: All dates used when searching are relative to the \fBlocal\fP time
zone, so unless you change the setting of your $index_format to include
a \(lq\fB%[...]\fP\(rq format, these are \fBnot\fP the dates shown in the main
index.

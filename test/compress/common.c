    "It is an ancient Mariner, And he stoppeth one of three.  'By thy long "
    "grey beard and glittering eye, Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?  The "
    "Bridegroom's doors are opened wide, And I am next of kin; The guests are "
    "met, the feast is set: May'st hear the merry din.' He holds him with his "
    "skinny hand, 'There was a ship,' quoth he.  'Hold off! unhand me, "
    "grey-beard loon!' Eftsoons his hand dropt he.  He holds him with his "
    "glittering eye— The Wedding-Guest stood still, And listens like a three "
    "years' child: The Mariner hath his will.  The Wedding-Guest sat on a "
    "stone: He cannot choose but hear; And thus spake on that ancient man, The "
    "bright-eyed Mariner.  'The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared, Merrily "
    "did we drop Below the kirk, below the hill, Below the lighthouse top.  "
    "The Sun came up upon the left, Out of the sea came he!  And he shone "
    "bright, and on the right Went down into the sea.  Higher and higher every "
    "day, Till over the mast at noon—' The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast, "
    "For he heard the loud bassoon.  The bride hath paced into the hall, Red "
    "as a rose is she; Nodding their heads before her goes The merry "
    "minstrelsy.  The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast, Yet he cannot choose "
    "but hear; And thus spake on that ancient man, The bright-eyed Mariner.  "
    "And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he Was tyrannous and strong: He struck "
    "with his o'ertaking wings, And chased us south along.  With sloping masts "
    "and dipping prow, As who pursued with yell and blow Still treads the "
    "shadow of his foe, And forward bends his head, The ship drove fast, loud "
    "roared the blast, And southward aye we fled.  And now there came both "
    "mist and snow, And it grew wondrous cold: And ice, mast-high, came "
    "floating by, As green as emerald.  And through the drifts the snowy "
    "clifts Did send a dismal sheen: Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken— The "
    "ice was all between.  The ice was here, the ice was there, The ice was "
    "all around: It cracked and growled, and roared and howled, Like noises in "
    "a swound!  At length did cross an Albatross, Thorough the fog it came; As "
    "if it had been a Christian soul, We hailed it in God's name.  It ate the "
    "food it ne'er had eat, And round and round it flew.  The ice did split "
    "with a thunder-fit; The helmsman steered us through!  And a good south "
    "wind sprung up behind; The Albatross did follow, And every day, for food "
    "or play, Came to the mariner's hollo!  In mist or cloud, on mast or "
    "shroud, It perched for vespers nine; Whiles all the night, through "
    "fog-smoke white, Glimmered the white Moon-shine.' 'God save thee, ancient "
    "Mariner!  From the fiends, that plague thee thus!— Why look'st thou "
    "so?'—With my cross-bow I shot the ALBATROSS.  The Sun now rose upon the "
    "right: Out of the sea came he, Still hid in mist, and on the left Went "
    "down into the sea.  And the good south wind still blew behind, But no "
    "sweet bird did follow, Nor any day for food or play Came to the mariner's "
    "hollo!  And I had done a hellish thing, And it would work 'em woe: For "
    "all averred, I had killed the bird That made the breeze to blow.  Ah "
    "wretch! said they, the bird to slay, That made the breeze to blow!  Nor "
    "dim nor red, like God's own head, The glorious Sun uprist: Then all "
    "averred, I had killed the bird That brought the fog and mist.  'Twas "
    "right, said they, such birds to slay, That bring the fog and mist.  The "
    "fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, The furrow followed free; We were "
    "the first that ever burst Into that silent sea.  Down dropt the breeze, "
    "the sails dropt down, 'Twas sad as sad could be; And we did speak only to "
    "break The silence of the sea!  All in a hot and copper sky, The bloody "
    "Sun, at noon, Right up above the mast did stand, No bigger than the Moon. "
    " Day after day, day after day, We stuck, nor breath nor motion; As idle "
    "as a painted ship Upon a painted ocean.  Water, water, every where, And "
    "all the boards did shrink; Water, water, every where, Nor any drop to "
    "drink.  The very deep did rot: O Christ!  That ever this should be!  Yea, "
    "slimy things did crawl with legs Upon the slimy sea.";

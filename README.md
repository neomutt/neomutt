A modern command-line email client, fork of Mutt with enhanced features

NeoMutt was started by Richard Russon (@FlatCap),
who took all the old patches and painstakingly sorted through them,
fixed them up and documented them.
He remains the lead developer and has done the bulk of the work to make NeoMutt what it is today.

## Features

See [docs/features/readme.md](docs/features/readme.md) for a detailed list of all NeoMutt features.

## Install

NeoMutt may be packaged for your distribution, and otherwise it can be
[built from source](https://neomutt.org/dev/build/build). Please refer to the
instructions on the [distro page](https://neomutt.org/distro.html).

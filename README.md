Welcome to NeoMutt—a modern, feature-rich email client forked from Mutt, with enhancements like sidebar navigation, Notmuch integration, and compose preview.

NeoMutt was started by Richard Russon (@FlatCap),
who took all the old patches and painstakingly sorted through them,
fixed them up and documented them.
He remains the lead developer and has done the bulk of the work to make NeoMutt what it is today.

## Quick Start

NeoMutt is included in most Linux distributions, making installation easy. Check [docs/distro.md](docs/distro.md) for your package manager commands.

If your distro doesn't have it, build from source:

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt`
- Install dependencies (see [docs/distro.md](docs/distro.md))
- Build: `./configure && make && make install`
- Launch: `neomutt`

## Features

See [docs/features/readme.md](docs/features/readme.md) for a detailed list of NeoMutt's features, including sidebar navigation, encryption support, Notmuch integration, and compose preview.

## Install

NeoMutt is included in many distributions. Please refer to [docs/distro.md](docs/distro.md) for package details. Otherwise, it can be
[built from source](docs/build.md).

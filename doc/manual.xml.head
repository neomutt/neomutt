<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Mutt</emphasis> is a small but very powerful
text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt is highly configurable, and is well
suited to the mail power user with advanced features like key bindings,
keyboard macros, mail threading, regular expression searches and a
powerful pattern matching language for selecting groups of messages.

<chapter id="gettingstarted">
<title>Getting Started</title>

<para>
This section is intended as a brief overview of how to use Mutt.  There
are many other features which are described elsewhere in the manual.
There is even more information available in the Mutt FAQ and various web
pages. See the <ulink url="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt homepage</ulink>
for more details.
</para>

<para>
The keybindings described in this section are the defaults as
distributed.  Your local system administrator may have altered the
defaults for your site.  You can always type <quote>?</quote> in any
menu to display the current bindings.
</para>

<para>
The first thing you need to do is invoke Mutt, simply by typing
<literal>mutt</literal> at the command line.  There are various
command-line options, see either the Mutt man page or the <link
linkend="commandline">reference</link>.
</para>

<sect1 id="core-concepts">
<title>Core Concepts</title>

<para>
Mutt is a text-based application which interacts with users through
different menus which are mostly line-/entry-based or page-based. A
line-based menu is the so-called <quote>index</quote> menu (listing all
messages of the currently opened folder) or the <quote>alias</quote>
menu (allowing you to select recipients from a list). Examples for
page-based menus are the <quote>pager</quote> (showing one message at a
time) or the <quote>help</quote> menu listing all available key
bindings.
</para>

<para>
The user interface consists of a context sensitive help line at the top,
the menu's contents followed by a context sensitive status line and
finally the command line. The command line is used to display
informational and error messages as well as for prompts and for entering
interactive commands.
</para>

<para>
Mutt is configured through variables which, if the user wants to
permanently use a non-default value, are written to configuration
files. Mutt supports a rich config file syntax to make even complex
configuration files readable and commentable.
</para>

<para>
Because Mutt allows for customizing almost all key bindings, there are
so-called <quote>functions</quote> which can be executed manually (using
the command line) or in macros. Macros allow the user to bind a sequence
of commands to a single key or a short key sequence instead of repeating
a sequence of actions over and over.
</para>

<para>
Many commands (such as saving or copying a message to another folder)
can be applied to a single message or a set of messages (so-called
<quote>tagged</quote> messages). To help selecting messages, Mutt
provides a rich set of message patterns (such as recipients, sender,
body contents, date sent/received, etc.) which can be combined into
complex expressions using the boolean <emphasis>and</emphasis> and
<emphasis>or</emphasis> operations as well as negating. These patterns
can also be used to (for example) search for messages or to limit the
index to show only matching messages.
</para>

<para>
Mutt supports a <quote>hook</quote> concept which allows the user to
execute arbitrary configuration commands and functions in certain
situations such as entering a folder, starting a new message or replying
to an existing one. These hooks can be used to highly customize Mutt's
behavior including managing multiple identities, customizing the
display for a folder or even implementing auto-archiving based on a
per-folder basis and much more.
</para>

<para>
Besides an interactive mode, Mutt can also be used as a command-line
tool only send messages. It also supports a
<literal>mailx(1)</literal>-compatible interface, see <xref
linkend="tab-commandline-options"/> for a complete list of command-line
options.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="concept-screens-and-menus">
<title>Screens and Menus</title>

<sect2 id="intro-index">
<title>Index</title>

<para>
The index is the screen that you usually see first when you start
Mutt. It gives an overview over your emails in the currently opened
mailbox. By default, this is your system mailbox.  The information you
see in the index is a list of emails, each with its number on the left,
its flags (new email, important email, email that has been forwarded or
replied to, tagged email, ...), the date when email was sent, its
sender, the email size, and the subject. Additionally, the index also
shows thread hierarchies: when you reply to an email, and the other
person replies back, you can see the other person's email in a
"sub-tree" below.  This is especially useful for personal email between
a group of people or when you've subscribed to mailing lists.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-pager">
<title>Pager</title>

<para>
The pager is responsible for showing the email content. On the top of
the pager you have an overview over the most important email headers
like the sender, the recipient, the subject, and much more
information. How much information you actually see depends on your
configuration, which we'll describe below.
</para>

<para>
Below the headers, you see the email body which usually contains the
message. If the email contains any attachments, you will see more
information about them below the email body, or, if the attachments are
text files, you can view them directly in the pager.
</para>

<para>
To give the user a good overview, it is possible to configure Mutt to
show different things in the pager with different colors. Virtually
everything that can be described with a regular expression can be
colored, e.g. URLs, email addresses or smileys.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-browser">
<title>File Browser</title>

<para>
The file browser is the interface to the local or remote file
system. When selecting a mailbox to open, the browser allows custom
sorting of items, limiting the items shown by a regular expression and a
freely adjustable format of what to display in which way. It also allows
for easy navigation through the file system when selecting file(s) to
attach to a message, select multiple files to attach and many more.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-sidebar">
  <title>Sidebar</title>
  <para>
    The Sidebar shows a list of all your mailboxes.  The list can be
    turned on and off, it can be themed and the list style can be
    configured.
  </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-help">
<title>Help</title>

<para>
The help screen is meant to offer a quick help to the user. It lists the
current configuration of key bindings and their associated commands
including a short description, and currently unbound functions that
still need to be associated with a key binding (or alternatively, they
can be called via the Mutt command prompt).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-compose">
<title>Compose Menu</title>

<para>
The compose menu features a split screen containing the information
which really matter before actually sending a message by mail: who gets
the message as what (recipients and who gets what kind of
copy). Additionally, users may set security options like deciding
whether to sign, encrypt or sign and encrypt a message with/for what
keys. Also, it's used to attach messages, to re-edit any attachment
including the message itself.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-alias">
<title>Alias Menu</title>

<para>
The alias menu is used to help users finding the recipients of
messages. For users who need to contact many people, there's no need to
remember addresses or names completely because it allows for searching,
too. The alias mechanism and thus the alias menu also features grouping
several addresses by a shorter nickname, the actual alias, so that users
don't have to select each single recipient manually.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="intro-attach">
<title>Attachment Menu</title>

<para>
As will be later discussed in detail, Mutt features a good and stable
MIME implementation, that is, it supports sending and receiving messages
of arbitrary MIME types. The attachment menu displays a message's
structure in detail: what content parts are attached to which parent
part (which gives a true tree structure), which type is of what type and
what size.  Single parts may saved, deleted or modified to offer great
and easy access to message's internals.

You can remap the <emphasis>editor</emphasis> functions using the <link

make the &lt;Delete&gt; key delete the character in front of the cursor
rather than under, you could use:
</para>

<screen>
bind editor &lt;delete&gt; backspace
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="editing-history">
<title>History</title>

<para>
Mutt maintains a history for the built-in editor.  The number of items
is controlled by the <link linkend="history">$history</link> variable
and can be made persistent using an external file specified using <link
linkend="history-file">$history_file</link>.  You may cycle through them
at an editor prompt by using the <literal>&lt;history-up&gt;</literal>
and/or <literal>&lt;history-down&gt;</literal> commands.  Mutt will
remember the currently entered text as you cycle through history, and
will wrap around to the initial entry line.
</para>

<para>
Mutt maintains several distinct history lists, one for each of the
following categories:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><literal>.muttrc</literal> commands</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>addresses and aliases</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>shell commands</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>filenames</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>patterns</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>everything else</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Mutt automatically filters out consecutively repeated items from the
history. It also mimics the behavior of some shells by ignoring items
starting with a space. The latter feature can be useful in macros to not
clobber the history's valuable entries with unwanted entries.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="reading">
<title>Reading Mail</title>

<para>
Similar to many other mail clients, there are two modes in which mail is
read in Mutt.  The first is a list of messages in the mailbox, which is
called the <quote>index</quote> menu in Mutt.  The second mode is the
display of the message contents.  This is called the
<quote>pager.</quote>

<title>The Pager</title>

<para>
By default, Mutt uses its built-in pager to display the contents of
messages (an external pager such as <literal>less(1)</literal> can be
configured, see <link linkend="pager">$pager</link> variable).  The
pager is very similar to the Unix program <literal>less(1)</literal>
though not nearly as featureful.

<para>
In addition to key bindings in <xref linkend="tab-key-pager"/>, many of
the functions from the index menu are also available in the pager, such
as <literal>&lt;delete-message&gt;</literal> or
<literal>&lt;copy-message&gt;</literal> (this is one advantage over
using an external pager to view messages).
</para>

<para>
Also, the internal pager supports a couple other advanced features. For
one, it will accept and translate the <quote>standard</quote> nroff
sequences for bold and underline. These sequences are a series of either
the letter, backspace (<quote>^H</quote>), the letter again for bold or
the letter, backspace, <quote>_</quote> for denoting underline. Mutt
will attempt to display these in bold and underline respectively if your
terminal supports them. If not, you can use the bold and underline <link
linkend="color">color</link> objects to specify a
<command>color</command> or mono attribute for them.
</para>

<para>
Additionally, the internal pager supports the ANSI escape sequences for
character attributes.  Mutt translates them into the correct color and
character settings.  The sequences Mutt supports are:
</para>

<screen>
\e[<emphasis>Ps</emphasis>;<emphasis>Ps</emphasis>;..<emphasis>Ps</emphasis>;m
</screen>

<para>
where <emphasis>Ps</emphasis> can be one of the codes shown in <xref

<para>
If you change the colors for your display, for example by changing the
color associated with color2 for your xterm, then that color will be

</para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
Note that the search commands in the pager take regular expressions,
which are not quite the same as the more complex <link
linkend="patterns">patterns</link> used by the search command in the
index. This is because patterns are used to select messages by criteria
whereas the pager already displays a selected message.

<sect2 id="threads">

<para>
So-called <quote>threads</quote> provide a hierarchy of messages where
replies are linked to their parent message(s). This organizational form
is extremely useful in mailing lists where different parts of the

</para>

<para>
In Mutt, when a mailbox is <link linkend="sort">sorted</link>

<para>
Collapsing a thread displays only the first message in the thread and
hides the others. This is useful when threads contain so many messages
that you can only see a handful of threads on the screen. See %M in
<link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>.  For example, you
could use <quote>%?M?(#%03M)&amp;(%4l)?</quote> in <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> to optionally display the
number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed. The
<literal>%?&lt;char&gt;?&lt;if-part&gt;&amp;&lt;else-part&gt;?</literal>
syntax is explained in detail in <link
linkend="formatstrings-conditionals">format string conditionals</link>.
</para>

<para>
Technically, every reply should contain a list of its parent messages in
the thread tree, but not all do. In these cases, Mutt groups them by
subject which can be controlled using the <link
linkend="strict-threads">$strict_threads</link> variable.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="reading-misc">
<title>Miscellaneous Functions</title>

<para>
In addition, the <emphasis>index</emphasis> and

</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;create-alias&gt;</literal><anchor id="create-alias"/>
(default: a)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Creates a new alias based upon the current message (or prompts for a new
one).  Once editing is complete, an <link
linkend="alias"><command>alias</command></link> command is added to the
file specified by the <link linkend="alias-file">$alias_file</link>
variable for future use
</para>

<note>
<para>
Mutt does not read the <link linkend="alias-file">$alias_file</link>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;check-traditional-pgp&gt;</literal><anchor
id="check-traditional-pgp"/> (default: Esc P)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This function will search the current message for content signed or
encrypted with PGP the <quote>traditional</quote> way, that is, without
proper MIME tagging.  Technically, this function will temporarily change
the MIME content types of the body parts containing PGP data; this is
similar to the <link
linkend="edit-type"><literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal></link>
function's effect.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;edit&gt;</literal><anchor id="edit"/> (default: e)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command (available in the index and pager) allows you to edit the
raw current message as it's present in the mail folder.  After you have
finished editing, the changed message will be appended to the current
folder, and the original message will be marked for deletion; if the
message is unchanged it won't be replaced.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal><anchor id="edit-type"/> (default:
^E on the attachment menu, and in the pager and index menus; ^T on the
compose menu)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command is used to temporarily edit an attachment's content type to
fix, for instance, bogus character set parameters.  When invoked from
the index or from the pager, you'll have the opportunity to edit the
top-level attachment's content type.  On the <link
linkend="attach-menu">attachment menu</link>, you can change any
attachment's content type. These changes are not persistent, and get
lost upon changing folders.
</para>

<para>
Note that this command is also available on the <link
linkend="compose-menu">compose menu</link>.  There, it's used to
fine-tune the properties of attachments you are going to send.
</para>

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;enter-command&gt;</literal><anchor id="enter-command"/>
(default: <quote>:</quote>)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command is used to execute any command you would normally put in a
configuration file.  A common use is to check the settings of variables,
or in conjunction with <link linkend="macro">macros</link> to change
settings on the fly.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;extract-keys&gt;</literal><anchor id="extract-keys"/>
(default: ^K)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command extracts PGP public keys from the current or tagged
message(s) and adds them to your PGP public key ring.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;forget-passphrase&gt;</literal><anchor
id="forget-passphrase"/> (default: ^F)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This command wipes the passphrase(s) from memory. It is useful, if you
misspelled the passphrase.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;list-reply&gt;</literal><anchor id="list-reply"/> (default:
L)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Reply to the current or tagged message(s) by extracting any addresses
which match the regular expressions given by the <link
linkend="lists"><command>lists</command> or
<command>subscribe</command></link> commands, but also honor any
<literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header(s) if the <link
linkend="honor-followup-to">$honor_followup_to</link> configuration
variable is set.  In addition, the <literal>List-Post</literal> header field is
examined for <literal>mailto:</literal> URLs specifying a mailing list address.
Using this when replying to messages posted to mailing lists helps avoid
duplicate copies being sent to the author of the message you are replying to.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;pipe-message&gt;</literal><anchor id="pipe-message"/>
(default: |)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Asks for an external Unix command and pipes the current or tagged
message(s) to it.  The variables <link
linkend="pipe-decode">$pipe_decode</link>, <link
linkend="pipe-split">$pipe_split</link>, <link
linkend="pipe-sep">$pipe_sep</link> and <link
linkend="wait-key">$wait_key</link> control the exact behavior of this
function.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;resend-message&gt;</literal><anchor id="resend-message"/>
(default: Esc e)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Mutt takes the current message as a template for a new message.  This
function is best described as "recall from arbitrary folders".  It can
conveniently be used to forward MIME messages while preserving the
original mail structure. Note that the amount of headers included here
depends on the value of the <link linkend="weed">$weed</link> variable.
</para>

<para>
This function is also available from the attachment menu. You can use
this to easily resend a message which was included with a bounce message
as a <literal>message/rfc822</literal> body part.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;shell-escape&gt;</literal><anchor id="shell-escape"/>
(default: !)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Asks for an external Unix command and executes it.  The <link
linkend="wait-key">$wait_key</link> can be used to control whether Mutt
will wait for a key to be pressed when the command returns (presumably
to let the user read the output of the command), based on the return
status of the named command. If no command is given, an interactive
shell is executed.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;toggle-quoted&gt;</literal><anchor id="toggle-quoted"/>
(default: T)
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
The pager uses the <link linkend="quote-regexp">$quote_regexp</link>
variable to detect quoted text when displaying the body of the message.
This function toggles the display of the quoted material in the message.
It is particularly useful when being interested in just the response and
there is a large amount of quoted text in the way.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>&lt;skip-quoted&gt;</literal><anchor id="skip-quoted"/>

When replying to messages, the <emphasis>In-Reply-To:</emphasis> header

<sect2 id="sending-crypto">
<title>Sending Cryptographically Signed/Encrypted Messages</title>

<para>
If you have told Mutt to PGP or S/MIME encrypt a message, it will guide
you through a key selection process when you try to send the message.
Mutt will not ask you any questions about keys which have a certified
user ID matching one of the message recipients' mail addresses.
However, there may be situations in which there are several keys, weakly
certified user ID fields, or where no matching keys can be found.
</para>

<para>
In these cases, you are dropped into a menu with a list of keys from
which you can select one.  When you quit this menu, or Mutt can't find
any matching keys, you are prompted for a user ID.  You can, as usually,
abort this prompt using <literal>^G</literal>.  When you do so, Mutt
will return to the compose screen.
</para>

<para>
Once you have successfully finished the key selection, the message will
be encrypted using the selected public keys when sent out.
</para>

<para>
Most fields of the entries in the key selection menu (see also <link
linkend="pgp-entry-format">$pgp_entry_format</link>) have obvious
meanings.  But some explanations on the capabilities, flags, and
validity fields are in order.
</para>

<para>
The flags sequence (<quote>%f</quote>) will expand to one of the flags
in <xref linkend="tab-pgp-menuflags"/>.

</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>

<para>
The capabilities field (<quote>%c</quote>) expands to a two-character
sequence representing a key's capabilities.  The first character gives
the key's encryption capabilities: A minus sign (<quote>-</quote>) means
that the key cannot be used for encryption.  A dot (<quote>.</quote>)
means that it's marked as a signature key in one of the user IDs, but
may also be used for encryption.  The letter <quote>e</quote> indicates
that this key can be used for encryption.
</para>

<para>
The second character indicates the key's signing capabilities.  Once
again, a <quote>-</quote> implies <quote>not for signing</quote>,
<quote>.</quote> implies that the key is marked as an encryption key in
one of the user-ids, and <quote>s</quote> denotes a key which can be
used for signing.
</para>

<para>
Finally, the validity field (<quote>%t</quote>) indicates how
well-certified a user-id is.  A question mark (<quote>?</quote>)
indicates undefined validity, a minus character (<quote>-</quote>) marks
an untrusted association, a space character means a partially trusted
association, and a plus character (<quote>+</quote>) indicates complete
validity.

<title>Concept</title>

<para>
<literal>format=flowed</literal>-style messages (or
<literal>f=f</literal> for short) are <literal>text/plain</literal>
messages that consist of paragraphs which a receiver's mail client may
reformat to its own needs which mostly means to customize line lengths
regardless of what the sender sent. Technically this is achieved by
letting lines of a <quote>flowable</quote> paragraph end in spaces
except for the last line.
</para>

<para>
While for text-mode clients like Mutt it's the best way to assume only a
standard 80x25 character cell terminal, it may be desired to let the
receiver decide completely how to view a message.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="ff-support">
<title>Mutt Support</title>

<para>
Mutt only supports setting the required <literal>format=flowed</literal>
MIME parameter on outgoing messages if the <link

it does not add the trailing spaces.
</para>

<para>
After editing the initial message text and before entering the compose

<emphasis>Space-stuffing</emphasis> is required by RfC3676 defining

<note>
<para>
Mutt only supports space-stuffing for the first two types of lines but
not for the third: It is impossible to safely detect whether a leading
<literal>&gt;</literal> character starts a quote or not. Furthermore,
Mutt only applies space-stuffing <emphasis>once</emphasis> after the
initial edit is finished.
</para>

As Mutt provides no additional features to compose

documentation if you intend to send <literal>f=f</literal> messages.
</para>

<para>
Please note that when editing messages from the compose menu several
times before really sending a mail, it's up to the user to ensure that
the message is properly space-stuffed.

<sect1 id="forwarding-mail">
<title>Forwarding and Bouncing Mail</title>

<para>
Bouncing and forwarding let you send an existing message to recipients
that you specify. Bouncing a message sends a verbatim copy of a message
to alternative addresses as if they were the message's original
recipients specified in the Bcc header.  Forwarding a message, on the
other hand, allows you to modify the message before it is resent (for
example, by adding your own comments). Bouncing is done using the
<literal>&lt;bounce&gt;</literal> function and forwarding using the
<literal>&lt;forward&gt;</literal> function bound to <quote>b</quote>
and <quote>f</quote> respectively.
</para>

<para>
Forwarding can be done by including the original message in the new
message's body (surrounded by indicating lines) or including it as a
MIME attachment, depending on the value of the <link
linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> variable.  Decoding of
attachments, like in the pager, can be controlled by the <link
linkend="forward-decode">$forward_decode</link> and <link
linkend="mime-forward-decode">$mime_forward_decode</link> variables,
respectively.  The desired forwarding format may depend on the content,
therefore <link linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is a
quadoption which, for example, can be set to <quote>ask-no</quote>.
</para>

<para>
The inclusion of headers is controlled by the current setting of the
<link linkend="weed">$weed</link> variable, unless <link
linkend="mime-forward">$mime_forward</link> is set.
</para>

<para>
Editing the message to forward follows the same procedure as sending or
replying to a message does.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="postponing-mail">
<title>Postponing Mail</title>

<para>
At times it is desirable to delay sending a message that you have
already begun to compose.  When the
<literal>&lt;postpone-message&gt;</literal> function is used in the
<emphasis>compose</emphasis> menu, the body of your message and
attachments are stored in the mailbox specified by the <link
linkend="postponed">$postponed</link> variable.  This means that you can
recall the message even if you exit Mutt and then restart it at a later
time.
</para>

<para>
Once a message is postponed, there are several ways to resume it.  From
the command line you can use the <quote>-p</quote> option, or if you
compose a new message from the <emphasis>index</emphasis> or
<emphasis>pager</emphasis> you will be prompted if postponed messages
exist.  If multiple messages are currently postponed, the
<emphasis>postponed</emphasis> menu will pop up and you can select which
message you would like to resume.
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you postpone a reply to a message, the reply setting of the message
is only updated when you actually finish the message and send it.  Also,
you must be in the same folder with the message you replied to for the
status of the message to be updated.

<title>Configuration</title>

<sect1 id="configuration-files">
<title>Location of Initialization Files</title>

<para>
While the default configuration (or <quote>preferences</quote>) make
Mutt usable right out of the box, it is often desirable to tailor Mutt
to suit your own tastes. When Mutt is first invoked, it will attempt to
read the <quote>system</quote> configuration file (defaults set by your
local system administrator), unless the <quote>-n</quote> <link
linkend="commandline">command line</link> option is specified.  This
file is typically <literal>/usr/local/share/mutt/Muttrc</literal> or
<literal>/etc/Muttrc</literal>. Mutt will next look for a file named
<literal>.muttrc</literal> in your home directory.  If this file does
not exist and your home directory has a subdirectory named
<literal>.mutt</literal>, Mutt tries to load a file named
<literal>.mutt/muttrc</literal>.
</para>

<para>
<literal>.muttrc</literal> is the file where you will usually place your
<link linkend="commands">commands</link> to configure Mutt.
</para>

<para>
In addition, Mutt supports version specific configuration files that are
parsed instead of the default files as explained above.  For instance,
if your system has a <literal>Muttrc-0.88</literal> file in the system
configuration directory, and you are running version 0.88 of Mutt, this
file will be sourced instead of the <literal>Muttrc</literal> file.  The
same is true of the user configuration file, if you have a file
<literal>.muttrc-0.88.6</literal> in your home directory, when you run
Mutt version 0.88.6, it will source this file instead of the default
<literal>.muttrc</literal> file.  The version number is the same which
is visible using the <quote>-v</quote> <link
linkend="commandline">command line</link> switch or using the
<literal>show-version</literal> key (default: V) from the index menu.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="muttrc-syntax" xreflabel="Syntax of Initialization Files">
<title>Syntax of Initialization Files</title>

<para>
An initialization file consists of a series of <link
linkend="commands">commands</link>.  Each line of the file may contain
one or more commands.  When multiple commands are used, they must be
separated by a semicolon (<quote>;</quote>).
</para>

<example id="ex-rc-multiple-cmds">
<title>Multiple configuration commands per line</title>
<screen>
set realname='Mutt user' ; ignore x-
</screen>
</example>

<para>
The hash mark, or pound sign (<quote>#</quote>), is used as a
<quote>comment</quote> character. You can use it to annotate your
initialization file. All text after the comment character to the end of
the line is ignored.
</para>

<example id="ex-ec-comment">
<title>Commenting configuration files</title>
<screen>
my_hdr X-Disclaimer: Why are you listening to me? <emphasis role="comment"># This is a comment</emphasis>
</screen>
</example>

<para>
Single quotes (<quote>'</quote>) and double quotes (<quote>"</quote>)
can be used to quote strings which contain spaces or other special
characters.  The difference between the two types of quotes is similar
to that of many popular shell programs, namely that a single quote is
used to specify a literal string (one that is not interpreted for shell
variables or quoting with a backslash [see next paragraph]), while
double quotes indicate a string for which should be evaluated.  For
example, backticks are evaluated inside of double quotes, but
<emphasis>not</emphasis> for single quotes.
</para>

<para>
<quote>\</quote> quotes the next character, just as in shells such as
bash and zsh.  For example, if want to put quotes <quote>"</quote>
inside of a string, you can use <quote>\</quote> to force the next
character to be a literal instead of interpreted character.
</para>

<example id="ex-rc-quote">
<title>Escaping quotes in configuration files</title>

<para>
<quote>\\</quote> means to insert a literal <quote>\</quote> into the line.
<quote>\n</quote> and <quote>\r</quote> have their usual C meanings of linefeed and
carriage-return, respectively.
</para>

<para>
A <quote>\</quote> at the end of a line can be used to split commands
over multiple lines as it <quote>escapes</quote> the line end, provided
that the split points don't appear in the middle of command names. Lines
are first concatenated before interpretation so that a multi-line can be
commented by commenting out the first line only.

<para>
It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix command in an
initialization file.  This is accomplished by enclosing the command in
backticks (``). In <xref linkend="ex-rc-backtick"/>, the output of the
Unix command <quote>uname -a</quote> will be substituted before the line
is parsed.  Since initialization files are line oriented, only the first
line of output from the Unix command will be substituted.

<para>
Both environment variables and Mutt variables can be accessed by
prepending <quote>$</quote> to the name of the variable. For example,
</para>

<example id="ex-rc-env">
<title>Using environment variables in configuration files</title>
<screen>
set record=+sent_on_$HOSTNAME

</example>

<para>
will cause Mutt to save outgoing messages to a folder named
<quote>sent_on_kremvax</quote> if the environment variable
<literal>$HOSTNAME</literal> is set to <quote>kremvax.</quote> (See
<link linkend="record">$record</link> for details.)
</para>

<para>
Mutt expands the variable when it is assigned, not when it is used. If
the value of a variable on the right-hand side of an assignment changes
after the assignment, the variable on the left-hand side will not be
affected.
</para>

<para>
The commands understood by Mutt are explained in the next paragraphs.
For a complete list, see the <link linkend="commands">command
reference</link>.
</para>

<para>
All configuration files are expected to be in the current locale as
specified by the <link linkend="charset">$charset</link> variable which
doesn't have a default value since it's determined by Mutt at startup.
If a configuration file is not encoded in the same character set the
<link linkend="config-charset">$config_charset</link> variable should be
used: all lines starting with the next are recoded from <link
linkend="config-charset">$config_charset</link> to <link
linkend="charset">$charset</link>.
</para>

<para>
This mechanism should be avoided if possible as it has the following
implications:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>These variables should be set early in a configuration

<para>
Mutt supports grouping addresses logically into named groups. An address
or address pattern can appear in several groups at the same time. These
groups can be used in <link linkend="patterns">patterns</link> (for searching, limiting and tagging) and
in hooks by using group patterns. This can be useful to classify mail
and take certain actions depending on in what groups the message is.
For example, the mutt user's mailing list would fit into the categories
<quote>mailing list</quote> and <quote>mutt-related</quote>. Using <link
linkend="send-hook"><literal>send-hook</literal></link>, the sender can
be set to a dedicated one for writing mailing list messages, and the
signature could be set to a mutt-related one for writing to a mutt list
&mdash; for other lists, the list sender setting still applies but a
different signature can be selected. Or, given a group only containing
recipients known to accept encrypted mail,
<quote>auto-encryption</quote> can be achieved easily.
</para>

<para>
The <command>group</command> command is used to directly add either
addresses or regular expressions to the specified group or groups. The
different categories of arguments to the <command>group</command>
command can be in any order. The flags <literal>-rx</literal> and
<literal>-addr</literal> specify what the following strings (that cannot
begin with a hyphen) should be interpreted as: either a regular
expression or an email address, respectively.
</para>

<para>
These address groups can also be created implicitly by the <link
linkend="alias"><command>alias</command></link>, <link
linkend="lists"><command>lists</command></link>, <link
linkend="lists"><command>subscribe</command></link> and <link
linkend="alternates"><command>alternates</command></link> commands by
specifying the optional <literal>-group</literal> option. For example,
</para>

<screen>
alternates -group me address1 address2
alternates -group me -group work address3
</screen>

<para>
would create a group named <quote>me</quote> which contains all your
addresses and a group named <quote>work</quote> which contains only your
work address <emphasis>address3</emphasis>. Besides many other
possibilities, this could be used to automatically mark your own
messages in a mailing list folder as read or use a special signature for
work-related messages.
</para>

<para>
The <command>ungroup</command> command is used to remove addresses or
regular expressions from the specified group or groups. The syntax is
similar to the <command>group</command> command, however the special
character <literal>*</literal> can be used to empty a group of all of
its contents. As soon as a group gets empty because all addresses and
regular expressions have been removed, it'll internally be removed, too
(i.e. there cannot be an empty group). When removing regular expressions
from a group, the pattern must be specified exactly as given to the
<command>group</command> command or <literal>-group</literal> argument.

<para>
It's usually very cumbersome to remember or type out the address of
someone you are communicating with.  Mutt allows you to create
<quote>aliases</quote> which map a short string to a full address.
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you want to create an alias for more than one address, you
<emphasis>must</emphasis> separate the addresses with a comma
(<quote>,</quote>).
</para>
</note>

<para>
The optional <literal>-group</literal> argument to
<command>alias</command> causes the aliased address(es) to be added to
the named <emphasis>group</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
To remove an alias or aliases (<quote>*</quote> means all aliases):
</para>

<screen>
alias muttdude me@cs.hmc.edu (Michael Elkins)
alias theguys manny, moe, jack
</screen>

<para>
Unlike other mailers, Mutt doesn't require aliases to be defined in a
special file.  The <command>alias</command> command can appear anywhere
in a configuration file, as long as this file is <link
linkend="source"><command>source</command>d</link>.  Consequently, you
can have multiple alias files, or you can have all aliases defined in
your <literal>.muttrc</literal>.
</para>

<para>
On the other hand, the <link
linkend="create-alias"><literal>&lt;create-alias&gt;</literal></link>
function can use only one file, the one pointed to by the <link
linkend="alias-file">$alias_file</link> variable (which is
<literal>~/.muttrc</literal> by default). This file is not special
either, in the sense that Mutt will happily append aliases to any file,
but in order for the new aliases to take effect you need to explicitly
<link linkend="source"><command>source</command></link> this file too.
</para>

<example id="ex-alias-external">
<title>Configuring external alias files</title>
<screen>
source /usr/local/share/Mutt.aliases
source ~/.mail_aliases
set alias_file=~/.mail_aliases
</screen>
</example>

<para>
To use aliases, you merely use the alias at any place in Mutt where Mutt
prompts for addresses, such as the <emphasis>To:</emphasis> or
<emphasis>Cc:</emphasis> prompt.  You can also enter aliases in your
editor at the appropriate headers if you have the <link
linkend="edit-headers">$edit_headers</link> variable set.
</para>

<para>
In addition, at the various address prompts, you can use the tab
character to expand a partial alias to the full alias.  If there are
multiple matches, Mutt will bring up a menu with the matching aliases.
In order to be presented with the full list of aliases, you must hit tab
without a partial alias, such as at the beginning of the prompt or after

<para>
It is often desirable to change settings based on which mailbox you are
reading.  The <command>folder-hook</command> command provides a method
by which you can execute any configuration command.
<emphasis>regexp</emphasis> is a regular expression specifying in which
mailboxes to execute <emphasis>command</emphasis> before loading.  If a
mailbox matches multiple <command>folder-hook</command>s, they are
executed in the order given in the <literal>.muttrc</literal>.
</para>

<para>
The regexp parameter has <link linkend="shortcuts">mailbox
shortcut</link> expansion performed on the first character.
See  <xref linkend="mailbox-hook"/> for more details.
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you use the <quote>!</quote> shortcut for <link
linkend="spoolfile">$spoolfile</link> at the beginning of the pattern,
you must place it inside of double or single quotes in order to
distinguish it from the logical <emphasis>not</emphasis> operator for
the expression.
</para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
Settings are <emphasis>not</emphasis> restored when you leave the
mailbox.  For example, a command action to perform is to change the
sorting method based upon the mailbox being read:
</para>

<screen>
folder-hook mutt "set sort=threads"</screen>

<para>
However, the sorting method is not restored to its previous value when
reading a different mailbox.  To specify a <emphasis>default</emphasis>
command, use the pattern <quote>.</quote> before other
<command>folder-hook</command>s adjusting a value on a per-folder basis
because <command>folder-hook</command>s are evaluated in the order given
in the configuration file.
</para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
The keyboard buffer will not be processed until after all hooks
are run; multiple <link linkend="push">push</link> or <link

</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>

<para>
Macros are useful when you would like a single key to perform a series
of actions.  When you press <emphasis>key</emphasis> in menu
<emphasis>menu</emphasis>, Mutt will behave as if you had typed
<emphasis>sequence</emphasis>.  So if you have a common sequence of
commands you type, you can create a macro to execute those commands with
a single key or fewer keys.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>menu</emphasis> is the <link linkend="maps">map</link> which
the macro will be bound in.  Multiple maps may be specified by
separating multiple menu arguments by commas. Whitespace may not be used
in between the menu arguments and the commas separating them.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>key</emphasis> and <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> are expanded
by the same rules as the <link linkend="bind">key bindings</link> with
some additions.  The first is that control characters in
<emphasis>sequence</emphasis> can also be specified as
<emphasis>^x</emphasis>.  In order to get a caret (<quote>^</quote>) you
need to use <emphasis>^^</emphasis>.  Secondly, to specify a certain key
such as <emphasis>up</emphasis> or to invoke a function directly, you
can use the format <emphasis>&lt;key name&gt;</emphasis> and
<emphasis>&lt;function name&gt;</emphasis>.  For a listing of key names
see the section on <link linkend="bind">key bindings</link>.  Functions
are listed in the <link linkend="functions">reference</link>.
</para>

<para>
The advantage with using function names directly is that the macros will
work regardless of the current key bindings, so they are not dependent
on the user having particular key definitions.  This makes them more
robust and portable, and also facilitates defining of macros in files
used by more than one user (e.g., the system Muttrc).
</para>

<para>
Optionally you can specify a descriptive text after
<emphasis>sequence</emphasis>, which is shown in the help screens if
they contain a description.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Macro definitions (if any) listed in the help screen(s), are
silently truncated at the screen width, and are not wrapped.

<para>
If your terminal supports color, you can spice up Mutt by creating your
own color scheme.  To define the color of an object (type of
information), you must specify both a foreground color
<emphasis>and</emphasis> a background color (it is not possible to only
specify one or the other).
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>header</emphasis> and <emphasis>body</emphasis> match
<emphasis>regexp</emphasis> in the header/body of a message,
<emphasis>index</emphasis> matches <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> (see

server-side searches (=b, =B, =h) are not supported for color index
patterns.

<emphasis>foreground</emphasis> can optionally be prefixed with the

</para>

<para>
If your terminal supports it, the special keyword
<emphasis>default</emphasis> can be used as a transparent color.  The
value <emphasis>brightdefault</emphasis> is also valid.  If Mutt is
linked against the <emphasis>S-Lang</emphasis> library, you also need to
set the <literal>$COLORFGBG</literal> environment variable to the
default colors of your terminal for this to work; for example (for
Bourne-like shells):
</para>

<screen>
set COLORFGBG="green;black"
export COLORFGBG
</screen>

<note>
<para>
The <emphasis>S-Lang</emphasis> library requires you to use the
<emphasis>lightgray</emphasis> and <emphasis>brown</emphasis> keywords
instead of <emphasis>white</emphasis> and <emphasis>yellow</emphasis>
when setting this variable.
</para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
The <command>uncolor</command> command can be applied to the index,
header and body objects only.  It removes entries from the list. You
<emphasis>must</emphasis> specify the same pattern specified in the
<command>color</command> command for it to be removed.  The pattern
<quote>*</quote> is a special token which means to clear the color list
of all entries.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Mutt also recognizes the keywords <emphasis>color0</emphasis>,
<emphasis>color1</emphasis>, ...,
<emphasis>color</emphasis><emphasis>N-1</emphasis>
(<emphasis>N</emphasis> being the number of colors supported by your
terminal).  This is useful when you remap the colors for your display
(for example by changing the color associated with
<emphasis>color2</emphasis> for your xterm), since color names may then
lose their normal meaning.

Messages often have many header fields added by automatic processing

command allows you to specify header fields which you don't normally
want to see in the pager.
</para>

<para>
You do not need to specify the full header field name.  For example,
<quote>ignore content-</quote> will ignore all header fields that begin
with the pattern <quote>content-</quote>. <quote>ignore *</quote> will
ignore all headers.
</para>

<para>
To remove a previously added token from the list, use the
<quote>unignore</quote> command.  The <quote>unignore</quote> command
will make Mutt display headers with the given pattern.  For example, if
you do <quote>ignore x-</quote> it is possible to <quote>unignore
x-mailer</quote>.
</para>

<quote>unignore *</quote> will remove all tokens from the ignore list.

original message's recipients &mdash; responding to yourself won't make
much sense in many cases.  (See <link
linkend="reply-to">$reply_to</link>.)
</para>

<para>
Many users receive e-mail under a number of different addresses. To
fully use Mutt's features here, the program must be able to recognize
what e-mail addresses you receive mail under. That's the purpose of the
<command>alternates</command> command: It takes a list of regular
expressions, each of which can identify an address under which you
receive e-mail.
</para>

<para>
As addresses are matched using regular expressions and not exact strict
comparisons, you should make sure you specify your addresses as precise
as possible to avoid mismatches. For example, if you specify:
</para>

<screen>
alternates user@example
</screen>

<para>
Mutt will consider <quote><literal>some-user@example</literal></quote>
as being your address, too which may not be desired. As a solution, in
such cases addresses should be specified as:
</para>

<screen>
alternates '^user@example$'
</screen>

<para>
The <literal>-group</literal> flag causes all of the subsequent regular
expressions to be added to the named group.
</para>

<para>
The <command>unalternates</command> command can be used to write
exceptions to <command>alternates</command> patterns. If an address
matches something in an <command>alternates</command> command, but you
nonetheless do not think it is from you, you can list a more precise
pattern under an <command>unalternates</command> command.
</para>

<para>
To remove a regular expression from the <command>alternates</command>
list, use the <command>unalternates</command> command with exactly the
same <emphasis>regexp</emphasis>.  Likewise, if the
<emphasis>regexp</emphasis> for an <command>alternates</command> command
matches an entry on the <command>unalternates</command> list, that
<command>unalternates</command> entry will be removed. If the
<emphasis>regexp</emphasis> for <command>unalternates</command> is
<quote>*</quote>, <emphasis>all entries</emphasis> on
<command>alternates</command> will be removed.

<para>
Mutt has a few nice features for <link linkend="using-lists">handling
mailing lists</link>.  In order to take advantage of them, you must
specify which addresses belong to mailing lists, and which mailing lists
you are subscribed to. Mutt also has limited support for auto-detecting
mailing lists: it supports parsing <literal>mailto:</literal> links in
the common <literal>List-Post:</literal> header which has the same
effect as specifying the list address via the <command>lists</command>
command (except the group feature). Once you have done this, the <link
linkend="list-reply"><literal>&lt;list-reply&gt;</literal></link>
function will work for all known lists.  Additionally, when you send a
message to a subscribed list, Mutt will add a Mail-Followup-To header to
tell other users' mail user agents not to send copies of replies to your
personal address.
</para>

<note>
<para>
The Mail-Followup-To header is a non-standard extension which is not
supported by all mail user agents.  Adding it is not bullet-proof
against receiving personal CCs of list messages.  Also note that the
generation of the Mail-Followup-To header is controlled by the <link
linkend="followup-to">$followup_to</link> configuration variable since
it's common practice on some mailing lists to send Cc upon replies
(which is more a group- than a list-reply).
</para>
</note>

<para>
More precisely, Mutt maintains lists of patterns for the addresses of
known and subscribed mailing lists.  Every subscribed mailing list is
known. To mark a mailing list as known, use the <command>list</command>
command.  To mark it as subscribed, use <command>subscribe</command>.
</para>

<para>
You can use regular expressions with both commands. To mark all messages
sent to a specific bug report's address on Debian's bug tracking system
as list mail, for instance, you could say
</para>

<screen>
subscribe [0-9]+.*@bugs.debian.org</screen>

<para>
as it's often sufficient to just give a portion of the list's e-mail
address.
</para>

<para>
Specify as much of the address as you need to to remove ambiguity.  For
example, if you've subscribed to the Mutt mailing list, you will receive
mail addressed to <literal>mutt-users@mutt.org</literal>.  So, to tell
Mutt that this is a mailing list, you could add <literal>lists
mutt-users@</literal> to your initialization file.  To tell Mutt that
you are subscribed to it, add <literal><command>subscribe</command>
mutt-users</literal> to your initialization file instead.  If you also
happen to get mail from someone whose address is
<literal>mutt-users@example.com</literal>, you could use
<literal><command>lists</command> ^mutt-users@mutt\\.org$</literal> or
<literal><command>subscribe</command> ^mutt-users@mutt\\.org$</literal>
to match only mail from the actual list.
</para>

<para>
The <literal>-group</literal> flag adds all of the subsequent regular
expressions to the named <link linkend="addrgroup">address group</link>
in addition to adding to the specified address list.
</para>

<para>
The <quote>unlists</quote> command is used to remove a token from the
list of known and subscribed mailing-lists. Use <quote>unlists *</quote>
to remove all tokens.
</para>

To remove a mailing list from the list of subscribed mailing lists, but
keep it on the list of known mailing lists, use
<command>unsubscribe</command>.

<note>
<para>
<command>reply-hook</command>s are matched <emphasis>before</emphasis> the

<command>send-hook</command> in the reply case by using the pattern

</para>
</note>

<para>
<command>send2-hook</command> is matched every time a message is

<para>
When encrypting messages with PGP/GnuPG or OpenSSL, you may want to
associate a certain key with a given e-mail address automatically,
either because the recipient's public key can't be deduced from the
destination address, or because, for some reasons, you need to override
the key Mutt would normally use.  The <command>crypt-hook</command>
command provides a method by which you can specify the ID of the public
key to be used when encrypting messages to a certain recipient.
You may use multiple crypt-hooks with the same regexp; multiple
matching crypt-hooks result in the use of multiple keyids for
a recipient.  During key selection, Mutt will confirm whether each
crypt-hook is to be used (unless the <link
linkend="crypt-confirmhook">$crypt_confirmhook</link> option is unset).
If all crypt-hooks for a recipient are declined, Mutt will use the
original recipient address for key selection instead.

<para>
This command adds the named string to the beginning of the keyboard buffer. The string

sequence string in the <link linkend="macro">macro</link> command. You
may use it to automatically run a sequence of commands at startup, or

<screen>
folder-hook . 'push &lt;collapse-all&gt;'
</screen>
</example>

<para>
For using functions like shown in the example, it's important to use
angle brackets (<quote>&lt;</quote> and <quote>&gt;</quote>) to make
Mutt recognize the input as a function name. Otherwise it will simulate
individual just keystrokes, i.e. <quote><literal>push
collapse-all</literal></quote> would be interpreted as if you had typed
<quote>c</quote>, followed by <quote>o</quote>, followed by
<quote>l</quote>, ..., which is not desired and may lead to very
unexpected behavior.
</para>

<para>
Keystrokes can be used, too, but are less portable because of
potentially changed key bindings. With default bindings, this is
equivalent to the above example:
</para>

<screen>
folder-hook . 'push \eV'

because it simulates that Esc+V was pressed (which is the default

the <command>spam</command> command. <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> should
be a regular expression that matches a header in a mail message. If any
message in the mailbox matches this regular expression, it will receive
a <quote>spam tag</quote> or <quote>spam attribute</quote> (unless it
also matches a <command>nospam</command> pattern &mdash; see below.) The
appearance of this attribute is entirely up to you, and is governed by
the <emphasis>format</emphasis> parameter. <emphasis>format</emphasis>
can be any static text, but it also can include back-references from the
<emphasis>pattern</emphasis> expression. (A regular expression
<quote>back-reference</quote> refers to a sub-expression contained
within parentheses.) <literal>%1</literal> is replaced with the first
back-reference in the regex, <literal>%2</literal> with the second, etc.
</para>

<para>
To match spam tags, mutt needs the corresponding header information
which is always the case for local and POP folders but not for IMAP in
the default configuration. Depending on the spam header to be analyzed,
<link linkend="imap-headers">$imap_headers</link> may need to be
adjusted.
</para>

<para>
If you're using multiple spam filters, a message can have more than one
spam-related header. You can define <command>spam</command> patterns for
each filter you use. If a message matches two or more of these patterns,
and the <link linkend="spam-separator">$spam_separator</link> variable
is set to a string, then the message's spam tag will consist of all the
<emphasis>format</emphasis> strings joined together, with the value of
<link linkend="spam-separator">$spam_separator</link> separating them.
</para>

<para>
For example, suppose one uses DCC, SpamAssassin, and PureMessage, then
the configuration might look like in <xref linkend="ex-spam"/>.
</para>

<example id="ex-spam">
<title>Configuring spam detection</title>
<screen>
spam "X-DCC-.*-Metrics:.*(....)=many"         "90+/DCC-%1"
spam "X-Spam-Status: Yes"                     "90+/SA"
spam "X-PerlMX-Spam: .*Probability=([0-9]+)%" "%1/PM"
set spam_separator=", "
</screen>
</example>

<para>
If then a message is received that DCC registered with
<quote>many</quote> hits under the <quote>Fuz2</quote> checksum, and
that PureMessage registered with a 97% probability of being spam, that
message's spam tag would read <literal>90+/DCC-Fuz2,
97/PM</literal>. (The four characters before <quote>=many</quote> in a
DCC report indicate the checksum used &mdash; in this case,
<quote>Fuz2</quote>.)
</para>

<para>
If the <link linkend="spam-separator">$spam_separator</link> variable is
unset, then each spam pattern match supersedes the previous one. Instead
of getting joined <emphasis>format</emphasis> strings, you'll get only
the last one to match.
</para>

<para>
The spam tag is what will be displayed in the index when you use
<literal>%H</literal> in the <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable. It's also the
string that the <literal>~H</literal> pattern-matching expression
matches against for <literal>&lt;search&gt;</literal> and
<literal>&lt;limit&gt;</literal> functions. And it's what sorting by
spam attribute will use as a sort key.
</para>

<para>
That's a pretty complicated example, and most people's actual
environments will have only one spam filter. The simpler your
configuration, the more effective Mutt can be, especially when it comes
to sorting.
</para>

<para>
Generally, when you sort by spam tag, Mutt will sort
<emphasis>lexically</emphasis> &mdash; that is, by ordering strings
alphanumerically. However, if a spam tag begins with a number, Mutt will
sort numerically first, and lexically only when two numbers are equal in
value. (This is like UNIX's <literal>sort -n</literal>.) A message with
no spam attributes at all &mdash; that is, one that didn't match
<emphasis>any</emphasis> of your <command>spam</command> patterns
&mdash; is sorted at lowest priority. Numbers are sorted next, beginning
with 0 and ranging upward. Finally, non-numeric strings are sorted, with
<quote>a</quote> taking lower priority than <quote>z</quote>. Clearly,
in general, sorting by spam tags is most effective when you can coerce
your filter to give you a raw number. But in case you can't, Mutt can
still do something useful.
</para>

<para>
The <command>nospam</command> command can be used to write exceptions to
<command>spam</command> patterns. If a header pattern matches something
in a <command>spam</command> command, but you nonetheless do not want it
to receive a spam tag, you can list a more precise pattern under a
<command>nospam</command> command.
</para>

<para>
If the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> given to <command>nospam</command>
is exactly the same as the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> on an existing
<command>spam</command> list entry, the effect will be to remove the
entry from the spam list, instead of adding an exception.  Likewise, if
the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> for a <command>spam</command> command
matches an entry on the <command>nospam</command> list, that nospam
entry will be removed. If the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> for
<command>nospam</command> is <quote>*</quote>, <emphasis>all entries on
both lists</emphasis> will be removed. This might be the default action
if you use <command>spam</command> and <command>nospam</command> in
conjunction with a <command>folder-hook</command>.
</para>

<para>
You can have as many <command>spam</command> or
<command>nospam</command> commands as you like.  You can even do your
own primitive <command>spam</command> detection within Mutt &mdash; for
example, if you consider all mail from <literal>MAILER-DAEMON</literal>
to be spam, you can use a <command>spam</command> command like this:
</para>

<screen>
spam "^From: .*MAILER-DAEMON"       "999"

<para>
This command is used to set (and unset) <link
linkend="variables">configuration variables</link>.  There are four
basic types of variables: boolean, number, string and quadoption.
<emphasis>boolean</emphasis> variables can be <emphasis>set</emphasis>
(true) or <emphasis>unset</emphasis> (false).
<emphasis>number</emphasis> variables can be assigned a positive integer
value.  <emphasis>string</emphasis> variables consist of any number of
printable characters and must be enclosed in quotes if they contain
spaces or tabs.  You may also use the escape sequences <quote>\n</quote>
and <quote>\t</quote> for newline and tab, respectively.
<emphasis>quadoption</emphasis> variables are used to control whether or
not to be prompted for certain actions, or to specify a default action.
A value of <emphasis>yes</emphasis> will cause the action to be carried
out automatically as if you had answered yes to the question.
Similarly, a value of <emphasis>no</emphasis> will cause the action to
be carried out as if you had answered <quote>no.</quote> A value of
<emphasis>ask-yes</emphasis> will cause a prompt with a default answer
of <quote>yes</quote> and <emphasis>ask-no</emphasis> will provide a
default answer of <quote>no.</quote>
</para>

<para>
Prefixing a variable with <quote>no</quote> will unset it.  Example:
<literal><command>set</command> noaskbcc</literal>.
</para>

<para>
For <emphasis>boolean</emphasis> variables, you may optionally prefix
the variable name with <literal>inv</literal> to toggle the value (on or
off).  This is useful when writing macros.  Example:
<literal><command>set</command> invsmart_wrap</literal>.
</para>

<para>
The <command>toggle</command> command automatically prepends the
<literal>inv</literal> prefix to all specified variables.
</para>

<para>
The <command>unset</command> command automatically prepends the
<literal>no</literal> prefix to all specified variables.
</para>

<para>
Using the <literal>&lt;enter-command&gt;</literal> function in the
<emphasis>index</emphasis> menu, you can query the value of a variable
by prefixing the name of the variable with a question mark:
</para>

<screen>
set ?allow_8bit
</screen>

<para>
The question mark is actually only required for boolean and quadoption
variables.
</para>

<para>
The <command>reset</command> command resets all given variables to the
compile time defaults (hopefully mentioned in this manual). If you use
the command <command>set</command> and prefix the variable with
<quote>&amp;</quote> this has the same behavior as the
<command>reset</command> command.
</para>

<para>
With the <command>reset</command> command there exists the special
variable <quote>all</quote>, which allows you to reset all variables to
their system defaults.

<title>User-Defined Variables</title>

<sect3 id="set-myvar-intro">
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
Along with the variables listed in the <link
linkend="variables">Configuration variables</link> section, Mutt
supports user-defined variables with names starting with
<literal>my_</literal> as in, for example, <literal>my_cfgdir</literal>.
</para>

<para>
The <command>set</command> command either creates a custom
<literal>my_</literal> variable or changes its value if it does exist
already. The <command>unset</command> and <command>reset</command>
commands remove the variable entirely.
</para>

<para>
Since user-defined variables are expanded in the same way that
environment variables are (except for the <link
linkend="shell-escape">shell-escape</link> command and backtick
expansion), this feature can be used to make configuration files more
readable.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="set-myvar-examples">
<title>Examples</title>

<para>
The following example defines and uses the variable
<literal>my_cfgdir</literal> to abbreviate the calls of the <link
linkend="source"><command>source</command></link> command:
</para>

<example id="ex-myvar1">
<title>Using user-defined variables for config file readability</title>
<screen>
set my_cfgdir = $HOME/mutt/config

source $my_cfgdir/hooks
source $my_cfgdir/macros
<emphasis role="comment"># more source commands...</emphasis>
</screen>
</example>

<para>
A custom variable can also be used in macros to backup the current value
of another variable. In the following example, the value of the <link
linkend="delete">$delete</link> is changed temporarily while its
original value is saved as <literal>my_delete</literal>.  After the
macro has executed all commands, the original value of <link
linkend="delete">$delete</link> is restored.
</para>

<example id="ex-myvar2">
<title>Using user-defined variables for backing up other config option values</title>
<screen>
macro pager ,x '\
&lt;enter-command&gt;set my_delete=$delete&lt;enter&gt;\

...\
&lt;enter-command&gt;set delete=$my_delete&lt;enter&gt;'
</screen>
</example>

<para>
Since Mutt expands such values already when parsing the configuration
file(s), the value of <literal>$my_delete</literal> in the
last example would be the value of <link linkend="delete">$delete</link> exactly
as it was at that point during parsing the configuration file. If
another statement would change the value for <link linkend="delete">$delete</link>
later in the same or another file, it would have no effect on
<literal>$my_delete</literal>. However, the expansion can
be deferred to runtime, as shown in the next example, when escaping the
dollar sign.

<example id="ex-myvar3">
<title>Deferring user-defined variable expansion to runtime</title>

</para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="set-conversions">
<title>Type Conversions</title>

<para>
Variables are always assigned string values which Mutt parses into its
internal representation according to the type of the variable, for
example an integer number for numeric types. For all queries (including
$-expansion) the value is converted from its internal type back into
string. As a result, any variable can be assigned any value given that
its content is valid for the target. This also counts for custom
variables which are of type string. In case of parsing errors, Mutt will
print error messages. <xref linkend="ex-myvar4"/> demonstrates type
conversions.
</para>

<example id="ex-myvar4">
<title>Type conversions using variables</title>
<screen>
set my_lines = "5"                <emphasis role="comment"># value is string "5"</emphasis>
set pager_index_lines = $my_lines <emphasis role="comment"># value is integer 5</emphasis>

set my_sort = "date-received"     <emphasis role="comment"># value is string "date-received"</emphasis>
set sort = "last-$my_sort"        <emphasis role="comment"># value is sort last-date-received</emphasis>

set my_inc = $read_inc            <emphasis role="comment"># value is string "10" (default of $read_inc)</emphasis>
set my_foo = $my_inc              <emphasis role="comment"># value is string "10"</emphasis>
</screen>
</example>

<para>
These assignments are all valid. If, however, the value of
<literal>$my_lines</literal> would have been
<quote>five</quote> (or something else that cannot be parsed into a
number), the assignment to
<literal>$pager_index_lines</literal> would have
produced an error message.
</para>

<para>
Type conversion applies to all configuration commands which take
arguments. But please note that every expanded value of a variable is
considered just a single token. A working example is:
</para>

<screen>
set my_pattern = "~A"
set my_number = "10"

<emphasis role="comment"># same as: score ~A +10</emphasis>
score $my_pattern +$my_number</screen>

<para>
What does <emphasis>not</emphasis> work is:
</para>

<screen>
set my_mx = "+mailbox1 +mailbox2"
mailboxes $my_mx +mailbox3</screen>

<para>
because the value of <literal>$my_mx</literal> is interpreted as a
single mailbox named <quote>+mailbox1 +mailbox2</quote> and not two
distinct mailboxes.

<sect1 id="formatstrings">
<title>Format Strings</title>

<sect2 id="formatstrings-basics">
<title>Basic usage</title>

<para>
Format strings are a general concept you'll find in several locations
through the Mutt configuration, especially in the <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>, <link
linkend="pager-format">$pager_format</link>, <link
linkend="status-format">$status_format</link>, and other related
variables. These can be very straightforward, and it's quite possible
you already know how to use them.
</para>

<para>
The most basic format string element is a percent symbol followed by
another character. For example, <literal>%s</literal> represents a
message's Subject: header in the <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable. The
<quote>expandos</quote> available are documented with each format
variable, but there are general modifiers available with all formatting
expandos, too. Those are our concern here.
</para>

<para>
Some of the modifiers are borrowed right out of C (though you might know
them from Perl, Python, shell, or another language). These are the
<literal>[-]m.n</literal> modifiers, as in
<literal>%-12.12s</literal>. As with such programming languages, these
modifiers allow you to specify the minimum and maximum size of the
resulting string, as well as its justification. If the <quote>-</quote>
sign follows the percent, the string will be left-justified instead of
right-justified. If there's a number immediately following that, it's
the minimum amount of space the formatted string will occupy &mdash; if
it's naturally smaller than that, it will be padded out with spaces.  If
a decimal point and another number follow, that's the maximum space
allowable &mdash; the string will not be permitted to exceed that width,
no matter its natural size. Each of these three elements is optional, so
that all these are legal format strings: <literal>%-12s</literal>,
<literal>%4c</literal>, <literal>%.15F</literal> and
<literal>%-12.15L</literal>.
</para>

<para>
Mutt adds some other modifiers to format strings. If you use an equals
symbol (<literal>=</literal>) as a numeric prefix (like the minus
above), it will force the string to be centered within its minimum space
range. For example, <literal>%=14y</literal> will reserve 14 characters
for the %y expansion &mdash; that's the X-Label: header, in <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>. If the expansion results in
a string less than 14 characters, it will be centered in a 14-character
space.  If the X-Label for a message were <quote>test</quote>, that
expansion would look like
<quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</quote>.
</para>

<para>
There are two very little-known modifiers that affect the way that an
expando is replaced. If there is an underline (<quote>_</quote>)
character between any format modifiers (as above) and the expando
letter, it will expands in all lower case. And if you use a colon
(<quote>:</quote>), it will replace all decimal points with underlines.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="formatstrings-conditionals">
<title>Conditionals</title>

<para>
Depending on the format string variable, some of its sequences can be
used to optionally print a string if their value is nonzero. For
example, you may only want to see the number of flagged messages if such
messages exist, since zero is not particularly meaningful. To optionally
print a string based upon one of the above sequences, the following
construct is used:
</para>

<screen>
%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;optional_string&gt;?</screen>

<para>
where <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is an expando, and
<emphasis>optional_string</emphasis> is the string you would like
printed if <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is nonzero.
<emphasis>optional_string</emphasis> may contain other sequences as well
as normal text, but you may not nest optional strings.
</para>

<para>
Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
new messages in a mailbox in <link
linkend="status-format">$status_format</link>:
</para>

<screen>
%?n?%n new messages.?</screen>

<para>
You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:
</para>

<screen>
%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;if_string&gt;&amp;&lt;else_string&gt;?</screen>

<para>
If the value of <emphasis>sequence_char</emphasis> is non-zero,
<emphasis>if_string</emphasis> will be expanded, otherwise
<emphasis>else_string</emphasis> will be expanded.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="formatstrings-filters">
<title>Filters</title>

<para>
Any format string ending in a vertical bar (<quote>|</quote>) will be
expanded and piped through the first word in the string, using spaces as
separator. The string returned will be used for display.  If the
returned string ends in %, it will be passed through the formatter a
second time. This allows the filter to generate a replacement format
string including % expandos.
</para>

<para>
All % expandos in a format string are expanded before the script is
called so that:
</para>

<example id="ex-fmtpipe">
<title>Using external filters in format strings</title>
<screen>
set status_format="script.sh '%r %f (%L)'|"
</screen>
</example>

<para>
will make Mutt expand <literal>%r</literal>, <literal>%f</literal> and
<literal>%L</literal> before calling the script. The example also shows
that arguments can be quoted: the script will receive the expanded
string between the single quotes as the only argument.
</para>

<para>
A practical example is the <literal>mutt_xtitle</literal> script
installed in the <literal>samples</literal> subdirectory of the Mutt
documentation: it can be used as filter for <link
linkend="status-format">$status_format</link> to set the current
terminal's title, if supported.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="formatstrings-padding">
<title>Padding</title>

<para>
In most format strings, Mutt supports different types of padding using
special %-expandos:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>%|X</literal></term>
<listitem>
<para>
When this occurs, Mutt will fill the rest of the line with the character
<literal>X</literal>. For example, filling the rest of the line with
dashes is done by setting:
</para>
<screen>
set status_format = "%v on %h: %B: %?n?%n&amp;no? new messages %|-"</screen>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<literal>%&gt;X</literal>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Since the previous expando stops at the end of line, there must be a way
to fill the gap between two items via the <literal>%&gt;X</literal>
expando: it puts as many characters <literal>X</literal> in between two
items so that the rest of the line will be right-justified. For example,
to not put the version string and hostname the above example on the left
but on the right and fill the gap with spaces, one might use (note the
space after <literal>%&gt;</literal>):
</para>

Normal right-justification will print everything to the left of the

priority to the right-hand side, guaranteeing space to display it and
showing padding only if there's still room. If necessary, soft-fill will
eat text leftwards to make room for rightward text. For example, to
right-justify the subject making sure as much as possible of it fits on
screen, one might use (note two spaces after <literal>%* </literal>: the
second ensures there's a space between the truncated right-hand side and

<para>
As a security measure, Mutt will only add user-approved header fields from a
<literal>mailto:</literal> URL.  This is necessary since Mutt will handle
certain header fields, such as <literal>Attach:</literal>, in a special way.
The <literal>mailto_allow</literal> and <literal>unmailto_allow</literal>
commands allow the user to modify the list of approved headers.
</para>
<para>
Mutt initializes the default list to contain only the <literal>Subject</literal>

<sect1 id="charset-handling">
<title>Character Set Handling</title>

<para>
A <quote>character set</quote> is basically a mapping between bytes and
glyphs and implies a certain character encoding scheme. For example, for
the ISO 8859 family of character sets, an encoding of 8bit per character
is used. For the Unicode character set, different character encodings
may be used, UTF-8 being the most popular. In UTF-8, a character is
represented using a variable number of bytes ranging from 1 to 4.
</para>

<para>
Since Mutt is a command-line tool run from a shell, and delegates
certain tasks to external tools (such as an editor for composing/editing
messages), all of these tools need to agree on a character set and
encoding. There exists no way to reliably deduce the character set a
plain text file has. Interoperability is gained by the use of
well-defined environment variables. The full set can be printed by
issuing <literal>locale</literal> on the command line.
</para>

<para>
Upon startup, Mutt determines the character set on its own using
routines that inspect locale-specific environment variables. Therefore,
it is generally not necessary to set the <literal>$charset</literal>
variable in Mutt. It may even be counter-productive as Mutt uses system
and library functions that derive the character set themselves and on
which Mutt has no influence. It's safest to let Mutt work out the locale
setup itself.
</para>

<para>
If you happen to work with several character sets on a regular basis,
it's highly advisable to use Unicode and an UTF-8 locale. Unicode can
represent nearly all characters in a message at the same time.  When not
using a Unicode locale, it may happen that you receive messages with
characters not representable in your locale. When displaying such a
message, or replying to or forwarding it, information may get lost
possibly rendering the message unusable (not only for you but also for
the recipient, this breakage is not reversible as lost information
cannot be guessed).
</para>

<para>
A Unicode locale makes all conversions superfluous which eliminates the
risk of conversion errors. It also eliminates potentially wrong
expectations about the character set between Mutt and external programs.
</para>

<para>
The terminal emulator used also must be properly configured for the
current locale. Terminal emulators usually do <emphasis>not</emphasis>
derive the locale from environment variables, they need to be configured
separately. If the terminal is incorrectly configured, Mutt may display
random and unexpected characters (question marks, octal codes, or just
random glyphs), format strings may not work as expected, you may not be
abled to enter non-ascii characters, and possible more.  Data is always
represented using bytes and so a correct setup is very important as to
the machine, all character sets <quote>look</quote> the same.
</para>

<para>
Warning: A mismatch between what system and library functions think the
locale is and what Mutt was told what the locale is may make it behave
badly with non-ascii input: it will fail at seemingly random places.
This warning is to be taken seriously since not only local mail handling
may suffer: sent messages may carry wrong character set information the
<emphasis>receiver</emphasis> has too deal with. The need to set
<literal>$charset</literal> directly in most cases points at terminal
and environment variable setup problems, not Mutt problems.
</para>

<para>
A list of officially assigned and known character sets can be found at
<ulink url="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">IANA</ulink>,
a list of locally supported locales can be obtained by running
<literal>locale -a</literal>.

<sect1 id="regexp">
<title>Regular Expressions</title>

<para>
All string patterns in Mutt including those in more complex <link
linkend="patterns">patterns</link> must be specified using regular
expressions (regexp) in the <quote>POSIX extended</quote> syntax (which
is more or less the syntax used by egrep and GNU awk).  For your
convenience, we have included below a brief description of this syntax.
</para>

<para>
The search is case sensitive if the pattern contains at least one upper
case letter, and case insensitive otherwise.
</para>

<note>
<para>
<quote>\</quote> must be quoted if used for a regular expression in an
initialization command: <quote>\\</quote>.
</para>
</note>

<para>
A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.
Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.
</para>

<note>
<para>
The regular expression can be enclosed/delimited by either " or ' which
is useful if the regular expression includes a white-space character.
See <xref linkend="muttrc-syntax"/> for more information on " and '
delimiter processing.  To match a literal " or ' you must preface it
with \ (backslash).
</para>
</note>

<para>
The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a
single character.  Most characters, including all letters and digits,
are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any metacharacter with
special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.
</para>

<para>
The period <quote>.</quote> matches any single character.  The caret
<quote>^</quote> and the dollar sign <quote>$</quote> are metacharacters
that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a
line.
</para>

<para>
A list of characters enclosed by <quote>[</quote> and <quote>]</quote>
matches any single character in that list; if the first character of the
list is a caret <quote>^</quote> then it matches any character
<emphasis>not</emphasis> in the list.  For example, the regular
expression <emphasis>[0123456789]</emphasis> matches any single digit.
A range of ASCII characters may be specified by giving the first and
last characters, separated by a hyphen <quote>-</quote>.  Most
metacharacters lose their special meaning inside lists.  To include a
literal <quote>]</quote> place it first in the list.  Similarly, to
include a literal <quote>^</quote> place it anywhere but first.
Finally, to include a literal hyphen <quote>-</quote> place it last.
</para>

<para>
Certain named classes of characters are predefined.  Character classes
consist of <quote>[:</quote>, a keyword denoting the class, and
<quote>:]</quote>.  The following classes are defined by the POSIX
standard in
<xref linkend="posix-regex-char-classes"/>

A character class is only valid in a regular expression inside the
brackets of a character list.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic
names, and must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the
bracket list. For example, <emphasis>[[:digit:]]</emphasis> is
equivalent to <emphasis>[0-9]</emphasis>.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Two additional special sequences can appear in character lists.  These
apply to non-ASCII character sets, which can have single symbols (called
collating elements) that are represented with more than one character,
as well as several characters that are equivalent for collating or
sorting purposes:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>Collating Symbols</term>
<listitem>
<para>
A collating symbol is a multi-character collating element enclosed in
<quote>[.</quote> and <quote>.]</quote>.  For example, if
<quote>ch</quote> is a collating element, then
<emphasis>[[.ch.]]</emphasis> is a regexp that matches this collating
element, while <emphasis>[ch]</emphasis> is a regexp that matches either
<quote>c</quote> or <quote>h</quote>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Equivalence Classes</term>
<listitem>
<para>
An equivalence class is a locale-specific name for a list of characters
that are equivalent. The name is enclosed in <quote>[=</quote> and
<quote>=]</quote>.  For example, the name <quote>e</quote> might be used
to represent all of <quote>e</quote> with grave
(<quote>&egrave;</quote>), <quote>e</quote> with acute
(<quote>&eacute;</quote>) and <quote>e</quote>.  In this case,
<emphasis>[[=e=]]</emphasis> is a regexp that matches any of:
<quote>e</quote> with grave (<quote>&egrave;</quote>), <quote>e</quote>
with acute (<quote>&eacute;</quote>) and <quote>e</quote>.

<para>
Special attention has to be payed when using regular expressions inside
of patterns.  Specifically, Mutt's parser for these patterns will strip
one level of backslash (<quote>\</quote>), which is normally used for
quoting.  If it is your intention to use a backslash in the regular
expression, you will need to use two backslashes instead
(<quote>\\</quote>). You can force Mutt to treat
<emphasis>EXPR</emphasis> as a simple string instead of a regular
expression by using = instead of ~ in the pattern name. For example,
<literal>=b *.*</literal> will find all messages that contain the
literal string <quote>*.*</quote>. Simple string matches are less
powerful than regular expressions but can be considerably faster. This
is especially true for IMAP folders, because string matches can be
performed on the server instead of by fetching every message. IMAP
treats <literal>=h</literal> specially: it must be of the form
<quote>header: substring</quote> and will not partially match header
names. The substring part may be omitted if you simply wish to find
messages containing a particular header without regard to its value.
</para>

<para>
Patterns matching lists of addresses (notably c, C, p, P and t) match if
there is at least one match in the whole list. If you want to make sure
that all elements of that list match, you need to prefix your pattern
with <quote>^</quote>.  This example matches all mails which only has
recipients from Germany.

<title>Simple Searches</title>

<para>
Mutt supports two versions of so called <quote>simple
searches</quote>. These are issued if the query entered for searching,
limiting and similar operations does not seem to contain a valid pattern
modifier (i.e. it does not contain one of these characters:
<quote>~</quote>, <quote>=</quote> or <quote>%</quote>). If the query is
supposed to contain one of these special characters, they must be
escaped by prepending a backslash (<quote>\</quote>).
</para>

<para>
The first type is by checking whether the query string equals
a keyword case-insensitively from <xref linkend="tab-simplesearch-keywords"/>:
If that is the case, Mutt will use the shown pattern modifier instead.
If a keyword would conflict with your search keyword, you need to turn
it into a regular expression to avoid matching the keyword table. For
example, if you want to find all messages matching <quote>flag</quote>
(using <link linkend="simple-search">$simple_search</link>)
but don't want to match flagged messages, simply search for
<quote><literal>[f]lag</literal></quote>.

Here is an example using white space in the regular expression (note the
<quote>'</quote> and <quote>"</quote> delimiters).  For this to match,
the mail's subject must match the <quote>^Junk +From +Me$</quote> and it
must be from either <quote>Jim +Somebody</quote> or <quote>Ed
+SomeoneElse</quote>:
</para>

<screen>
'~s "^Junk +From +Me$" ~f ("Jim +Somebody"|"Ed +SomeoneElse")'
</screen>

<note>
<para>
If a regular expression contains parenthesis, or a vertical bar ("|"),
you <emphasis>must</emphasis> enclose the expression in double or single
quotes since those characters are also used to separate different parts
of Mutt's pattern language.  For example: <literal>~f
"me@(mutt\.org|cs\.hmc\.edu)"</literal> Without the quotes, the
parenthesis wouldn't end.  This would be separated to two OR'd patterns:
<emphasis>~f me@(mutt\.org</emphasis> and
<emphasis>cs\.hmc\.edu)</emphasis>. They are never what you want.

<sect2 id="date-patterns">
<title>Searching by Date</title>

<para>
Mutt supports two types of dates, <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> and
<emphasis>relative</emphasis>.
</para>

<sect3 id="date-absolute">
<title>Absolute Dates</title>

<para>
Dates <emphasis>must</emphasis> be in DD/MM/YY format (month and year
are optional, defaulting to the current month and year).  An example of
a valid range of dates is:
</para>

<screen>
Limit to messages matching: ~d 20/1/95-31/10
</screen>

<para>
If you omit the minimum (first) date, and just specify
<quote>-DD/MM/YY</quote>, all messages <emphasis>before</emphasis> the
given date will be selected.  If you omit the maximum (second) date, and
specify <quote>DD/MM/YY-</quote>, all messages
<emphasis>after</emphasis> the given date will be selected.  If you
specify a single date with no dash (<quote>-</quote>), only messages
sent on the given date will be selected.
</para>

<para>
You can add error margins to absolute dates.  An error margin is a sign
(+ or -), followed by a digit, followed by one of the units in <xref
linkend="tab-date-units"/>. As a special case, you can replace the sign
by a <quote>*</quote> character, which is equivalent to giving identical
plus and minus error margins.

<sect1 id="tags">
<title>Using Tags</title>

<para>
Sometimes it is desirable to perform an operation on a group of messages
all at once rather than one at a time.  An example might be to save
messages to a mailing list to a separate folder, or to delete all
messages with a given subject.  To tag all messages matching a pattern,
use the <literal>&lt;tag-pattern&gt;</literal> function, which is bound
to <quote>shift-T</quote> by default.  Or you can select individual
messages by hand using the <literal>&lt;tag-message&gt;</literal>
function, which is bound to <quote>t</quote> by default.  See <link
linkend="patterns">patterns</link> for Mutt's pattern matching syntax.
</para>

<para>
Once you have tagged the desired messages, you can use the
<quote>tag-prefix</quote> operator, which is the <quote>;</quote>
(semicolon) key by default.  When the <quote>tag-prefix</quote> operator
is used, the <emphasis>next</emphasis> operation will be applied to all
tagged messages if that operation can be used in that manner.  If the
<link linkend="auto-tag">$auto_tag</link> variable is set, the next
operation applies to the tagged messages automatically, without
requiring the <quote>tag-prefix</quote>.
</para>

<para>
In <link linkend="macro"><command>macro</command>s</link> or <link
linkend="push"><command>push</command></link> commands, you can use the
<literal>&lt;tag-prefix-cond&gt;</literal> operator.  If there are no
tagged messages, Mutt will <quote>eat</quote> the rest of the macro to
abort it's execution.  Mutt will stop <quote>eating</quote> the macro
when it encounters the <literal>&lt;end-cond&gt;</literal> operator;
after this operator the rest of the macro will be executed as normal.

<sect1 id="hooks">
<title>Using Hooks</title>

<para>
A <emphasis>hook</emphasis> is a concept found in many other programs
which allows you to execute arbitrary commands before performing some
operation.  For example, you may wish to tailor your configuration based
upon which mailbox you are reading, or to whom you are sending mail.  In
the Mutt world, a <emphasis>hook</emphasis> consists of a <link

</para>

<note>
<para>
If a hook changes configuration settings, these changes remain effective
until the end of the current Mutt session. As this is generally not
desired, a <quote>default</quote> hook needs to be added before all
other hooks of that type to restore configuration defaults.
</para>
</note>

<example id="ex-default-hook">
<title>Specifying a <quote>default</quote> hook</title>

</example>

<para>
In <xref linkend="ex-default-hook"/>, by default the value of <link
linkend="from">$from</link> and <link
linkend="realname">$realname</link> is not overridden. When sending
messages either To: or Cc: to <literal>&lt;b@b.b&gt;</literal>, the
From: header is changed to <literal>&lt;c@c.c&gt;</literal>.
</para>

<sect2 id="pattern-hook" xreflabel="Message Matching in Hooks">
<title>Message Matching in Hooks</title>

<para>
Hooks that act upon messages (<command>message-hook</command>,
<command>reply-hook</command>, <command>send-hook</command>,
<command>send2-hook</command>, <command>save-hook</command>,
<command>fcc-hook</command>) are evaluated in a slightly different
manner. For the other types of hooks, a <link linkend="regexp">regular
expression</link> is sufficient.  But in dealing with messages a finer
grain of control is needed for matching since for different purposes you
want to match different criteria.
</para>

<para>
Mutt allows the use of the <link linkend="patterns">search
pattern</link> language for matching messages in hook commands.  This
works in exactly the same way as it would when
<emphasis>limiting</emphasis> or <emphasis>searching</emphasis> the
mailbox, except that you are restricted to those operators which match
information Mutt extracts from the header of the message (i.e., from,
to, cc, date, subject, etc.).
</para>

<para>
For example, if you wanted to set your return address based upon sending
mail to a specific address, you could do something like:
</para>

<screen>
send-hook '~t ^me@cs\.hmc\.edu$' 'my_hdr From: Mutt User &lt;user@host&gt;'
</screen>

<para>
which would execute the given command when sending mail to
<emphasis>me@cs.hmc.edu</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
However, it is not required that you write the pattern to match using
the full searching language.  You can still specify a simple
<emphasis>regular expression</emphasis> like the other hooks, in which
case Mutt will translate your pattern into the full language, using the
translation specified by the <link
linkend="default-hook">$default_hook</link> variable.  The pattern is
translated at the time the hook is declared, so the value of <link
linkend="default-hook">$default_hook</link> that is in effect at that
time will be used.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="mailbox-hook" xreflabel="Mailbox Matching in Hooks">
<title>Mailbox Matching in Hooks</title>

<para>
Hooks that match against mailboxes (<command>folder-hook</command>,
<command>mbox-hook</command>) apply both <link linkend="regexp">regular
expression</link> syntax as well as <link linkend="shortcuts">mailbox
shortcut</link> expansion on the regexp parameter.  There is some
overlap between these, so special attention should be paid to the first
character of the regexp.
</para>

<screen>
# Here, ^ will expand to "the current mailbox" not "beginning of string":
folder-hook ^/home/user/Mail/bar "set sort=threads"

# If you want ^ to be interpreted as "beginning of string", one workaround
# is to enclose the regexp in parenthesis:
folder-hook (^/home/user/Mail/bar) "set sort=threads"

# This will expand to the default save folder for the alias "imap.example.com", which
# is probably not what you want:
folder-hook @imap.example.com "set sort=threads"

# A workaround is to use parenthesis or a backslash:
folder-hook (@imap.example.com) "set sort=threads"
folder-hook '\@imap.example.com' "set sort=threads"
</screen>

<para>
Keep in mind that mailbox shortcut expansion on the regexp parameter
takes place when the hook is initially parsed, not when the hook is
matching against a mailbox.  When Mutt starts up and is reading the
.muttrc, some mailbox shortcuts may not be usable.  For example, the
"current mailbox" shortcut, ^, will expand to an empty string because no
mailbox has been opened yet.  Mutt will issue an error for this case or
if the mailbox shortcut results in an empty regexp.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="query">
<title>External Address Queries</title>

<para>
Mutt supports connecting to external directory databases such as LDAP,
ph/qi, bbdb, or NIS through a wrapper script which connects to Mutt
using a simple interface.  Using the <link
linkend="query-command">$query_command</link> variable, you specify the
wrapper command to use.  For example:
</para>

<screen>
set query_command = "mutt_ldap_query.pl %s"
</screen>

<para>
The wrapper script should accept the query on the command-line.  It
should return a one line message, then each matching response on a
single line, each line containing a tab separated address then name then
some other optional information.  On error, or if there are no matching
addresses, return a non-zero exit code and a one line error message.
</para>

<para>
An example multiple response output:
</para>

<screen>
Searching database ... 20 entries ... 3 matching:
me@cs.hmc.edu           Michael Elkins  mutt dude
blong@fiction.net       Brandon Long    mutt and more
roessler@does-not-exist.org        Thomas Roessler mutt pgp
</screen>

<para>
There are two mechanisms for accessing the query function of Mutt.  One
is to do a query from the index menu using the
<literal>&lt;query&gt;</literal> function (default: Q).  This will
prompt for a query, then bring up the query menu which will list the
matching responses.  From the query menu, you can select addresses to
create aliases, or to mail.  You can tag multiple addresses to mail,
start a new query, or have a new query appended to the current
responses.
</para>

<para>
The other mechanism for accessing the query function is for address
completion, similar to the alias completion.  In any prompt for address
entry, you can use the <literal>&lt;complete-query&gt;</literal>
function (default: ^T) to run a query based on the current address you
have typed.  Like aliases, Mutt will look for what you have typed back
to the last space or comma.  If there is a single response for that
query, Mutt will expand the address in place.  If there are multiple
responses, Mutt will activate the query menu.  At the query menu, you
can select one or more addresses to be added to the prompt.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="mailbox-formats">
<title>Mailbox Formats</title>

<para>
Mutt supports reading and writing of four different local mailbox
formats: mbox, MMDF, MH and Maildir.  The mailbox type is auto detected,
so there is no need to use a flag for different mailbox types.  When
creating new mailboxes, Mutt uses the default specified with the <link
linkend="mbox-type">$mbox_type</link> variable. A short description of
the formats follows.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>mbox</emphasis>.  This is a widely used mailbox format for
UNIX.  All messages are stored in a single file.  Each message has a
line of the form:
</para>

<screen>
From me@cs.hmc.edu Fri, 11 Apr 1997 11:44:56 PST
</screen>

<para>
to denote the start of a new message (this is often referred to as the
<quote>From_</quote> line). The mbox format requires mailbox locking, is
prone to mailbox corruption with concurrently writing clients or
misinterpreted From_ lines. Depending on the environment, new mail
detection can be unreliable. Mbox folders are fast to open and easy to
archive.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>MMDF</emphasis>.  This is a variant of the
<emphasis>mbox</emphasis> format.  Each message is surrounded by lines
containing <quote>^A^A^A^A</quote> (four times control-A's). The same
problems as for mbox apply (also with finding the right message
separator as four control-A's may appear in message bodies).
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>MH</emphasis>. A radical departure from
<emphasis>mbox</emphasis> and <emphasis>MMDF</emphasis>, a mailbox
consists of a directory and each message is stored in a separate file.
The filename indicates the message number (however, this is may not
correspond to the message number Mutt displays). Deleted messages are
renamed with a comma (<quote>,</quote>) prepended to the filename. Mutt
detects this type of mailbox by looking for either
<literal>.mh_sequences</literal> or <literal>.xmhcache</literal> files
(needed to distinguish normal directories from MH mailboxes). MH is more
robust with concurrent clients writing the mailbox, but still may suffer
from lost flags; message corruption is less likely to occur than with
mbox/mmdf. It's usually slower to open compared to mbox/mmdf since many
small files have to be read (Mutt provides <xref
linkend="header-caching"/> to greatly speed this process up).  Depending
on the environment, MH is not very disk-space efficient.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Maildir</emphasis>.  The newest of the mailbox formats, used
by the Qmail MTA (a replacement for sendmail).  Similar to
<emphasis>MH</emphasis>, except that it adds three subdirectories of the
mailbox: <emphasis>tmp</emphasis>, <emphasis>new</emphasis> and
<emphasis>cur</emphasis>.  Filenames for the messages are chosen in such
a way they are unique, even when two programs are writing the mailbox
over NFS, which means that no file locking is needed and corruption is
very unlikely. Maildir maybe slower to open without caching in Mutt, it
too is not very disk-space efficient depending on the environment. Since
no additional files are used for metadata (which is embedded in the
message filenames) and Maildir is locking-free, it's easy to sync across
different machines using file-level synchronization tools.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="shortcuts">
<title>Mailbox Shortcuts</title>

<para>
There are a number of built in shortcuts which refer to specific
mailboxes.  These shortcuts can be used anywhere you are prompted for a
file or mailbox path or in path-related configuration variables. Note
that these only work at the beginning of a string.

</sect1>

<sect1 id="using-lists">
<title>Handling Mailing Lists</title>

<para>
Mutt has a few configuration options that make dealing with large
amounts of mail easier.  The first thing you must do is to let Mutt know
what addresses you consider to be mailing lists (technically this does
not have to be a mailing list, but that is what it is most often used
for), and what lists you are subscribed to.  This is accomplished
through the use of the <link linkend="lists"><command>lists</command>
and <command>subscribe</command></link> commands in your
<literal>.muttrc</literal>.
</para>

<para>
Now that Mutt knows what your mailing lists are, it can do several
things, the first of which is the ability to show the name of a list
through which you received a message (i.e., of a subscribed list) in the
<emphasis>index</emphasis> menu display.  This is useful to distinguish
between personal and list mail in the same mailbox.  In the <link
linkend="index-format">$index_format</link> variable, the expando
<quote>%L</quote> will print the string <quote>To &lt;list&gt;</quote>
when <quote>list</quote> appears in the <quote>To</quote> field, and
<quote>Cc &lt;list&gt;</quote> when it appears in the <quote>Cc</quote>
field (otherwise it prints the name of the author).
</para>

<para>
Often times the <quote>To</quote> and <quote>Cc</quote> fields in
mailing list messages tend to get quite large. Most people do not bother
to remove the author of the message they reply to from the list,
resulting in two or more copies being sent to that person.  The
<literal>&lt;list-reply&gt;</literal> function, which by default is
bound to <quote>L</quote> in the <emphasis>index</emphasis> menu and
<emphasis>pager</emphasis>, helps reduce the clutter by only replying to
the known mailing list addresses instead of all recipients (except as
specified by <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal>, see below).
</para>

<para>
Mutt also supports the <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header.  When
you send a message to a list of recipients which includes one or several
subscribed mailing lists, and if the <link
linkend="followup-to">$followup_to</link> option is set, Mutt will
generate a Mail-Followup-To header which contains all the recipients to
whom you send this message, but not your address. This indicates that
group-replies or list-replies (also known as <quote>followups</quote>)
to this message should only be sent to the original recipients of the
message, and not separately to you - you'll receive your copy through
one of the mailing lists you are subscribed to.
</para>

<para>
Conversely, when group-replying or list-replying to a message which has
a <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header, Mutt will respect this
header if the <link
linkend="honor-followup-to">$honor_followup_to</link> configuration
variable is set.  Using <link linkend="list-reply">list-reply</link>
will in this case also make sure that the reply goes to the mailing
list, even if it's not specified in the list of recipients in the
<literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal>.
</para>

<note>
<para>
When header editing is enabled, you can create a
<literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header manually.  Mutt will only
auto-generate this header if it doesn't exist when you send the message.
</para>
</note>

<para>
The other method some mailing list admins use is to generate a
<quote>Reply-To</quote> field which points back to the mailing list
address rather than the author of the message.  This can create problems
when trying to reply directly to the author in private, since most mail
clients will automatically reply to the address given in the
<quote>Reply-To</quote> field.  Mutt uses the <link
linkend="reply-to">$reply_to</link> variable to help decide which
address to use.  If set to <emphasis>ask-yes</emphasis> or
<emphasis>ask-no</emphasis>, you will be prompted as to whether or not
you would like to use the address given in the <quote>Reply-To</quote>
field, or reply directly to the address given in the <quote>From</quote>
field.  When set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, the
<quote>Reply-To</quote> field will be used when present.
</para>

<para>
The <quote>X-Label:</quote> header field can be used to further identify
mailing lists or list subject matter (or just to annotate messages
individually).  The <link linkend="index-format">$index_format</link>
variable's <quote>%y</quote> and <quote>%Y</quote> expandos can be used
to expand <quote>X-Label:</quote> fields in the index, and Mutt's
pattern-matcher can match regular expressions to <quote>X-Label:</quote>
fields with the <quote>~y</quote> selector.  <quote>X-Label:</quote> is
not a standard message header field, but it can easily be inserted by
procmail and other mail filtering agents.
</para>

<para>
Lastly, Mutt has the ability to <link linkend="sort">sort</link> the
mailbox into <link linkend="threads">threads</link>.  A thread is a
group of messages which all relate to the same subject.  This is usually
organized into a tree-like structure where a message and all of its
replies are represented graphically.  If you've ever used a threaded
news client, this is the same concept.  It makes dealing with large
volume mailing lists easier because you can easily delete uninteresting
threads and quickly find topics of value.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="new-mail">
<title>New Mail Detection</title>

<para>
Mutt supports setups with multiple folders, allowing all of them to be
monitored for new mail (see <xref linkend="mailboxes"/> for details).
</para>

<sect2 id="new-mail-formats">
<title>How New Mail Detection Works</title>

<para>
For Mbox and Mmdf folders, new mail is detected by comparing access
and/or modification times of files: Mutt assumes a folder has new mail
if it wasn't accessed after it was last modified. Utilities like
<literal>biff</literal> or <literal>frm</literal> or any other program
which accesses the mailbox might cause Mutt to never detect new mail for
that mailbox if they do not properly reset the access time. Other
possible causes of Mutt not detecting new mail in these folders are
backup tools (updating access times) or filesystems mounted without
access time update support (for Linux systems, see the
<literal>relatime</literal> option).
</para>

<note>
<para>
Contrary to older Mutt releases, it now maintains the new mail status of
a folder by properly resetting the access time if the folder contains at
least one message which is neither read, nor deleted, nor marked as old.
</para>
</note>

<para>
In cases where new mail detection for Mbox or Mmdf folders appears to be
unreliable, the <link linkend="check-mbox-size">$check_mbox_size</link>
option can be used to make Mutt track and consult file sizes for new
mail detection instead which won't work for size-neutral changes.
</para>

<para>
New mail for Maildir is assumed if there is one message in the
<literal>new/</literal> subdirectory which is not marked deleted (see
<link linkend="maildir-trash">$maildir_trash</link>). For MH folders, a
mailbox is considered having new mail if there's at least one message in
the <quote>unseen</quote> sequence as specified by <link
linkend="mh-seq-unseen">$mh_seq_unseen</link>.
</para>

<para>
Mutt does not poll POP3 folders for new mail, it only periodically
checks the currently opened folder (if it's a POP3 folder).
</para>

<para>
For IMAP, by default Mutt uses recent message counts provided by the
server to detect new mail. If the <link
linkend="imap-idle">$imap_idle</link> option is set, it'll use the IMAP
IDLE extension if advertised by the server.
</para>

<para>
The <link linkend="mail-check-recent">$mail_check_recent</link>
option changes whether Mutt will notify you of new mail in an
already visited mailbox.  When set (the default) it will only notify
you of new mail received since the last time you opened the mailbox.
When unset, Mutt will notify you of any new mail in the mailbox.
</para>

<sect2 id="new-mail-polling">
<title>Polling For New Mail</title>

<para>
When in the index menu and being idle (also see <link
linkend="timeout">$timeout</link>), Mutt periodically checks for new
mail in all folders which have been configured via the
<command>mailboxes</command> command. The interval depends on the folder
type: for local/IMAP folders it consults <link
linkend="mail-check">$mail_check</link> and <link
linkend="pop-checkinterval">$pop_checkinterval</link> for POP folders.
</para>

<para>
Outside the index menu the directory browser supports checking for new
mail using the <literal>&lt;check-new&gt;</literal> function which is
unbound by default. Pressing TAB will bring up a menu showing the files
specified by the <command>mailboxes</command> command, and indicate
which contain new messages. Mutt will automatically enter this mode when
invoked from the command line with the <literal>-y</literal> option.
</para>

<para>
For the pager, index and directory browser menus, Mutt contains the
<literal>&lt;buffy-list&gt;</literal> function (bound to
<quote>.</quote> by default) which will print a list of folders with new
mail in the command line at the bottom of the screen.
</para>

<para>
For the index, by default Mutt displays the number of mailboxes with new
mail in the status bar, please refer to the <link

</para>

<para>
When changing folders, Mutt fills the prompt with the first folder from
the mailboxes list containing new mail (if any), pressing
<literal>&lt;Space&gt;</literal> will cycle through folders with new
mail.  The (by default unbound) function
<literal>&lt;next-unread-mailbox&gt;</literal> in the index can be used
to immediately open the next folder with unread mail (if any).

has not enough information to guess the correct threading.  You can fix
this by tagging the reply, then moving to the parent message and using

<title>Mutt's MIME Support</title>

<para>
Quite a bit of effort has been made to make Mutt the premier text-mode
MIME MUA.  Every effort has been made to provide the functionality that
the discerning MIME user requires, and the conformance to the standards
wherever possible.  When configuring Mutt for MIME, there are two extra
types of configuration files which Mutt uses.  One is the
<literal>mime.types</literal> file, which contains the mapping of file
extensions to IANA MIME types.  The other is the
<literal>mailcap</literal> file, which specifies the external commands
to use for handling specific MIME types.
</para>

<sect1 id="using-mime">
<title>Using MIME in Mutt</title>

<sect2 id="mime-overview">
<title>MIME Overview</title>

<para>
MIME is short for <quote>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension</quote>
and describes mechanisms to internationalize and structure mail
messages. Before the introduction of MIME, messages had a single text
part and were limited to us-ascii header and content. With MIME,
messages can have attachments (and even attachments which itself have
attachments and thus form a tree structure), nearly arbitrary characters
can be used for sender names, recipients and subjects.
</para>

<para>
Besides the handling of non-ascii characters in message headers, to Mutt
the most important aspect of MIME are so-called MIME types. These are
constructed using a <emphasis>major</emphasis> and
<emphasis>minor</emphasis> type separated by a forward slash.  These
specify details about the content that follows. Based upon these, Mutt
decides how to handle this part. The most popular major type is
<quote><literal>text</literal></quote> with minor types for plain text,
HTML and various other formats. Major types also exist for images,
audio, video and of course general application data (e.g. to separate
cryptographically signed data with a signature, send office documents,
and in general arbitrary binary data). There's also the
<literal>multipart</literal> major type which represents the root of a
subtree of MIME parts. A list of supported MIME types can be found in
<xref linkend="supported-mime-types"/>.
</para>

<para>
MIME also defines a set of encoding schemes for transporting MIME
content over the network: <literal>7bit</literal>,
<literal>8bit</literal>, <literal>quoted-printable</literal>,
<literal>base64</literal> and <literal>binary</literal>. There're some
rules when to choose what for encoding headers and/or body (if needed),
and Mutt will in general make a good choice.
</para>

<para>
Mutt does most of MIME encoding/decoding behind the scenes to form
messages conforming to MIME on the sending side. On reception, it can be
flexibly configured as to how what MIME structure is displayed (and if
it's displayed): these decisions are based on the content's MIME type.
There are three areas/menus in dealing with MIME: the pager (while
viewing a message), the attachment menu and the compose menu.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="mime-pager">
<title>Viewing MIME Messages in the Pager</title>

<para>
When you select a message from the index and view it in the pager, Mutt
decodes as much of a message as possible to a text representation.  Mutt
internally supports a number of MIME types, including the
<literal>text</literal> major type (with all minor types), the
<literal>message/rfc822</literal> (mail messages) type and some
<literal>multipart</literal> types. In addition, it recognizes a variety
of PGP MIME types, including PGP/MIME and
<literal>application/pgp</literal>.
</para>

<para>
Mutt will denote attachments with a couple lines describing them.
These lines are of the form:
</para>

<screen>
[-- Attachment #1: Description --]
[-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: 10000 --]
</screen>

<para>
Where the <emphasis>Description</emphasis> is the description or
filename given for the attachment, and the <emphasis>Encoding</emphasis>
is one of the already mentioned content encodings.
</para>

<para>
If Mutt cannot deal with a MIME type, it will display a message like:
</para>

<screen>
[-- image/gif is unsupported (use 'v' to view this part) --]
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="attach-menu">
<title>The Attachment Menu</title>

<para>
The default binding for <literal>&lt;view-attachments&gt;</literal> is
<quote>v</quote>, which displays the attachment menu for a message.  The
attachment menu displays a list of the attachments in a message.  From
the attachment menu, you can save, print, pipe, delete, and view
attachments.  You can apply these operations to a group of attachments
at once, by tagging the attachments and by using the
<literal>&lt;tag-prefix&gt;</literal> operator.  You can also reply to
the current message from this menu, and only the current attachment (or
the attachments tagged) will be quoted in your reply.  You can view
attachments as text, or view them using the mailcap viewer definition
(the mailcap mechanism is explained later in detail).
</para>

<para>
Finally, you can apply the usual message-related functions (like <link
linkend="resend-message"><literal>&lt;resend-message&gt;</literal></link>,
and the <literal>&lt;reply&gt;</literal> and
<literal>&lt;forward&gt;</literal> functions) to attachments of type
<literal>message/rfc822</literal>.

See table <xref linkend="tab-attachment-bindings"/> for all available
functions.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="compose-menu">
<title>The Compose Menu</title>

<para>
The compose menu is the menu you see before you send a message.  It
allows you to edit the recipient list, the subject, and other aspects of
your message.  It also contains a list of the attachments of your
message, including the main body.  From this menu, you can print, copy,
filter, pipe, edit, compose, review, and rename an attachment or a list
of tagged attachments.  You can also modifying the attachment
information, notably the type, encoding and description.
</para>

<para>
Attachments appear as follows by default:
</para>

<screen>
- 1 [text/plain, 7bit, 1K]           /tmp/mutt-euler-8082-0 &lt;no description&gt;
  2 [applica/x-gunzip, base64, 422K] ~/src/mutt-0.85.tar.gz &lt;no description&gt;
</screen>

<para>
The <quote>-</quote> denotes that Mutt will delete the file after
sending (or postponing, or canceling) the message.  It can be toggled
with the <literal>&lt;toggle-unlink&gt;</literal> command (default: u).
The next field is the MIME content-type, and can be changed with the
<literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal> command (default: ^T).  The next
field is the encoding for the attachment, which allows a binary message
to be encoded for transmission on 7bit links.  It can be changed with
the <literal>&lt;edit-encoding&gt;</literal> command (default: ^E).  The
next field is the size of the attachment, rounded to kilobytes or
megabytes.  The next field is the filename, which can be changed with
the <literal>&lt;rename-file&gt;</literal> command (default: R).  The
final field is the description of the attachment, and can be changed
with the <literal>&lt;edit-description&gt;</literal> command (default:
d). See <link linkend="attach-format">$attach_format</link> for a full
list of available expandos to format this display to your needs.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="mime-types">
<title>MIME Type Configuration with <literal>mime.types</literal></title>

<para>
To get most out of MIME, it's important that a MIME part's content type
matches the content as closely as possible so that the recipient's
client can automatically select the right viewer for the
content. However, there's no reliable for Mutt to know how to detect
every possible file type. Instead, it uses a simple plain text mapping
file that specifies what file extension corresponds to what MIME
type. This file is called <literal>mime.types</literal>.
</para>

<para>
When you add an attachment to your mail message, Mutt searches your
personal <literal>mime.types</literal> file at
<literal>$HOME/.mime.types</literal>, and then the system
<literal>mime.types</literal> file at
<literal>/usr/local/share/mutt/mime.types</literal> or
<literal>/etc/mime.types</literal>
</para>

<para>
Each line starts with the full MIME type, followed by a space and
space-separated list of file extensions. For example you could use:
</para>

<example id="ex-mime-types">
<title><literal>mime.types</literal></title>
<screen>
application/postscript          ps eps
application/pgp                 pgp
audio/x-aiff                    aif aifc aiff
</screen>
</example>

<para>
A sample <literal>mime.types</literal> file comes with the Mutt
distribution, and should contain most of the MIME types you are likely
to use.
</para>

<para>
If Mutt can not determine the MIME type by the extension of the file you
attach, it will look at the file.  If the file is free of binary
information, Mutt will assume that the file is plain text, and mark it
as <literal>text/plain</literal>.  If the file contains binary
information, then Mutt will mark it as
<literal>application/octet-stream</literal>.  You can change the MIME
type that Mutt assigns to an attachment by using the
<literal>&lt;edit-type&gt;</literal> command from the compose menu
(default: ^T), see <xref linkend="supported-mime-types"/> for supported
major types. Mutt recognizes all of these if the appropriate entry is
found in the <literal>mime.types</literal> file. Non-recognized mime
types should only be used if the recipient of the message is likely to
be expecting such attachments.

<sect1 id="mailcap">
<title>MIME Viewer Configuration with Mailcap</title>

<para>
Mutt supports RFC 1524 MIME Configuration, in particular the Unix
specific format specified in Appendix A of RFC 1524.  This file format
is commonly referred to as the <quote>mailcap</quote> format.  Many MIME
compliant programs utilize the mailcap format, allowing you to specify
handling for all MIME types in one place for all programs.  Programs
known to use this format include Firefox, lynx and metamail.
</para>

<para>
In order to handle various MIME types that Mutt doesn't have built-in
support for, it parses a series of external configuration files to find
an external handler. The default search string for these files is a
colon delimited list containing the following files:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para><literal>$HOME/.mailcap</literal></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>$PKGDATADIR/mailcap</literal></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><literal>/usr/etc/mailcap</literal></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>/usr/local/etc/mailcap</literal></para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
where <literal>$HOME</literal> is your home directory. The
<literal>$PKGDATADIR</literal> and the <literal>$SYSCONFDIR</literal>
directories depend on where Mutt is installed: the former is the default
for shared data, the latter for system configuration files.
</para>

<para>
The default search path can be obtained by running the following
command:
</para>

<screen>
mutt -nF /dev/null -Q mailcap_path
</screen>

<para>
In particular, the metamail distribution will install a mailcap file,
usually as <literal>/usr/local/etc/mailcap</literal>, which contains
some baseline entries.
</para>

<sect2 id="mailcap-basics">
<title>The Basics of the Mailcap File</title>

<para>
A mailcap file consists of a series of lines which are comments, blank,
or definitions.
</para>

<para>
A comment line consists of a # character followed by anything you want.
</para>

<para>
A blank line is blank.
</para>

<para>
A definition line consists of a content type, a view command, and any
number of optional fields.  Each field of a definition line is divided
by a semicolon <quote>;</quote> character.
</para>

<para>
The content type is specified in the MIME standard
<quote>type/subtype</quote> notation.  For example,
<literal>text/plain</literal>, <literal>text/html</literal>,
<literal>image/gif</literal>, etc.  In addition, the mailcap format
includes two formats for wildcards, one using the special
<quote>*</quote> subtype, the other is the implicit wild, where you only
include the major type.  For example, <literal>image/*</literal>, or
<literal>video</literal> will match all image types and video types,
respectively.
</para>

<para>
The view command is a Unix command for viewing the type specified. There
are two different types of commands supported. The default is to send
the body of the MIME message to the command on stdin. You can change
this behavior by using <literal>%s</literal> as a parameter to your view
command.  This will cause Mutt to save the body of the MIME message to a
temporary file, and then call the view command with the
<literal>%s</literal> replaced by the name of the temporary file. In
both cases, Mutt will turn over the terminal to the view program until
the program quits, at which time Mutt will remove the temporary file if
it exists. This means that mailcap does <emphasis>not</emphasis> work
out of the box with programs which detach themselves from the terminal
right after starting, like <literal>open</literal> on Mac OS X. In order
to nevertheless use these programs with mailcap, you probably need
custom shell scripts.
</para>

<para>
So, in the simplest form, you can send a <literal>text/plain</literal>
message to the external pager more on standard input:
</para>

<screen>
text/plain; more
</screen>

<para>
Or, you could send the message as a file:
</para>

<screen>
text/plain; more %s
</screen>

<para>
Perhaps you would like to use lynx to interactively view a
<literal>text/html</literal> message:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx %s
</screen>

<para>
In this case, lynx does not support viewing a file from standard input,
so you must use the <literal>%s</literal> syntax.
</para>

<note>
<para>
<emphasis>Some older versions of lynx contain a bug where they will
check the mailcap file for a viewer for <literal>text/html</literal>.
They will find the line which calls lynx, and run it.  This causes lynx
to continuously spawn itself to view the object.</emphasis>
</para>
</note>

<para>
On the other hand, maybe you don't want to use lynx interactively, you
just want to have it convert the <literal>text/html</literal> to
<literal>text/plain</literal>, then you can use:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx -dump %s | more
</screen>

<para>
Perhaps you wish to use lynx to view <literal>text/html</literal> files,
and a pager on all other text formats, then you would use the following:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx %s
text/*; more
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="secure-mailcap">
<title>Secure Use of Mailcap</title>

<para>
The interpretation of shell meta-characters embedded in MIME parameters
can lead to security problems in general.  Mutt tries to quote
parameters in expansion of <literal>%s</literal> syntaxes properly, and
avoids risky characters by substituting them, see the <link
linkend="mailcap-sanitize">$mailcap_sanitize</link> variable.
</para>

<para>
Although Mutt's procedures to invoke programs with mailcap seem to be
safe, there are other applications parsing mailcap, maybe taking less
care of it.  Therefore you should pay attention to the following rules:
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Keep the %-expandos away from shell quoting.</emphasis> Don't
quote them with single or double quotes.  Mutt does this for you, the
right way, as should any other program which interprets mailcap.  Don't
put them into backtick expansions.  Be highly careful with evil
statements, and avoid them if possible at all.  Trying to fix broken
behavior with quotes introduces new leaks &mdash; there is no
alternative to correct quoting in the first place.
</para>

<para>
If you have to use the %-expandos' values in context where you need
quoting or backtick expansions, put that value into a shell variable and
reference the shell variable where necessary, as in the following
example (using <literal>$charset</literal> inside the backtick expansion
is safe, since it is not itself subject to any further expansion):
</para>

<screen>
text/test-mailcap-bug; cat %s; copiousoutput; test=charset=%{charset} \
        &amp;&amp; test "`echo $charset | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`" != iso-8859-1

<title>Advanced Mailcap Usage</title>

<sect3 id="optional-mailcap-fields">
<title>Optional Fields</title>

<para>
In addition to the required content-type and view command fields, you
can add semi-colon <quote>;</quote> separated fields to set flags and
other options.  Mutt recognizes the following optional fields:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>copiousoutput</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This flag tells Mutt that the command passes possibly large amounts of
text on standard output.  This causes Mutt to invoke a pager (either
the internal pager or the external pager defined by the pager variable)
on the output of the view command.  Without this flag, Mutt assumes that
the command is interactive.  One could use this to replace the pipe to
<literal>more</literal> in the <literal>lynx -dump</literal> example in
the Basic section:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx -dump %s ; copiousoutput
</screen>

<para>
This will cause lynx to format the <literal>text/html</literal> output
as <literal>text/plain</literal> and Mutt will use your standard pager
to display the results.
</para>

<para>
Mutt will set the <literal>COLUMNS</literal> environment variable to
the width of the pager.  Some programs make use of this environment
variable automatically.  Others provide a command line argument that
can use this to set the output width:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx -dump -width ${COLUMNS:-80} %s; copiousoutput
</screen>

<para>
Note that when using the built-in pager, <emphasis>only</emphasis>
entries with this flag will be considered a handler for a MIME type
&mdash; all other entries will be ignored.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>needsterminal</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Mutt uses this flag when viewing attachments with <link
linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link>, in order to
decide whether it should honor the setting of the <link
linkend="wait-key">$wait_key</link> variable or not.  When an attachment
is viewed using an interactive program, and the corresponding mailcap

<term>nametemplate=&lt;template&gt;</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This field specifies the format for the file denoted by
<literal>%s</literal> in the command fields.  Certain programs will
require a certain file extension, for instance, to correctly view a
file.  For instance, lynx will only interpret a file as
<literal>text/html</literal> if the file ends in
<literal>.html</literal>.  So, you would specify lynx as a
<literal>text/html</literal> viewer with a line in the mailcap file
like:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html
</screen>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>test=&lt;command&gt;</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This field specifies a command to run to test whether this mailcap entry
should be used.  The command is defined with the command expansion rules
defined in the next section.  If the command returns 0, then the test
passed, and Mutt uses this entry.  If the command returns non-zero, then
the test failed, and Mutt continues searching for the right entry.  Note
that the content-type must match before Mutt performs the test.  For
example:
</para>

<screen>
text/html; firefox -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
text/html; lynx %s
</screen>

<para>
In this example, Mutt will run the program <literal>RunningX</literal>
which will return 0 if the X Window manager is running, and non-zero if
it isn't.  If <literal>RunningX</literal> returns 0, then Mutt will run
firefox to display the <literal>text/html</literal> object.  If RunningX
doesn't return 0, then Mutt will go on to the next entry and use lynx to
display the <literal>text/html</literal> object.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="mailcap-search-order">
<title>Search Order</title>

<para>
When searching for an entry in the mailcap file, Mutt will search for
the most useful entry for its purpose.  For instance, if you are
attempting to print an <literal>image/gif</literal>, and you have the
following entries in your mailcap file, Mutt will search for an entry
with the print command:
</para>

<screen>
image/*;        xv %s
image/gif;      ; print= anytopnm %s | pnmtops | lpr; \
                nametemplate=%s.gif
</screen>

<para>
Mutt will skip the <literal>image/*</literal> entry and use the
<literal>image/gif</literal> entry with the print command.
</para>

<para>
In addition, you can use this with <link
linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link> to denote two
commands for viewing an attachment, one to be viewed automatically, the
other to be viewed interactively from the attachment menu using the
<literal>&lt;view-mailcap&gt;</literal> function (bound to
<quote>m</quote> by default). In addition, you can then use the test
feature to determine which viewer to use interactively depending on your
environment.
</para>

<screen>
text/html;      firefox -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
text/html;      lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html
text/html;      lynx -dump %s; nametemplate=%s.html; copiousoutput
</screen>

<para>
For <link linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link>, Mutt
will choose the third entry because of the
<literal>copiousoutput</literal> tag.  For interactive viewing, Mutt
will run the program <literal>RunningX</literal> to determine if it
should use the first entry.  If the program returns non-zero, Mutt will
use the second entry for interactive viewing. The last entry is for
inline display in the pager and the
<literal>&lt;view-attach&gt;</literal> function in the attachment menu.
</para>

<para>
Entries with the <literal>copiousoutput</literal> tag should always be
specified as the last one per type. For non-interactive use, the last
entry will then actually be the first matching one with the tag set.
For non-interactive use, only <literal>copiousoutput</literal>-tagged
entries are considered. For interactive use, Mutt ignores this tag and
treats all entries equally. Therefore, if not specified last, all
following entries without this tag would never be considered for
<literal>&lt;view-attach&gt;</literal> because the
<literal>copiousoutput</literal> before them matched already.
</para>

The various commands defined in the mailcap files are passed to the

</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>%s</term>
<listitem>
<para>
As seen in the basic mailcap section, this variable is expanded to a
filename specified by the calling program.  This file contains the body
of the message to view/print/edit or where the composing program should
place the results of composition.  In addition, the use of this keyword
causes Mutt to not pass the body of the message to the view/print/edit
program on stdin.
</para>

</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>%t</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Mutt will expand <literal>%t</literal> to the text representation of the

message contains:
</para>

<screen>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
</screen>

<para>
then Mutt will expand <literal>%{charset}</literal> to

<para>
In addition to explicitly telling Mutt to view an attachment with the
MIME viewer defined in the mailcap file from the attachments menu, Mutt
has support for automatically viewing MIME attachments while in the
pager.
</para>

<para>
For this to work, you must define a viewer in the mailcap file which
uses the <literal>copiousoutput</literal> option to denote that it is
non-interactive.  Usually, you also use the entry to convert the
attachment to a text representation which you can view in the pager.
</para>

<para>
You then use the <command>auto_view</command> configuration command to
list the content-types that you wish to view automatically.  For
instance, if you set it to:
</para>

<screen>
auto_view text/html application/x-gunzip \
  application/postscript image/gif application/x-tar-gz
</screen>

<para>
...Mutt would try to find corresponding entries for rendering
attachments of these types as text. A corresponding mailcap could look
like:
</para>

<screen>
text/html;      lynx -dump %s; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html
image/*;        anytopnm %s | pnmscale -xsize 80 -ysize 50 | ppmtopgm | \

application/x-tar-gz; gunzip -c %s | tar -tf - ; copiousoutput
application/postscript; ps2ascii %s; copiousoutput
</screen>

<para>
<command>unauto_view</command> can be used to remove previous entries
from the <command>auto_view</command> list.  This can be used with <link
linkend="message-hook"><command>message-hook</command></link> to
autoview messages based on size, etc.
<quote><command>unauto_view</command> *</quote> will remove all previous
entries.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="alternative-order">
<title>MIME Multipart/Alternative</title>

<para>
The <literal>multipart/alternative</literal> container type only has
child MIME parts which represent the same content in an alternative
way. This is often used to send HTML messages which contain an
alternative plain text representation.
</para>

<para>
Mutt has some heuristics for determining which attachment of a
<literal>multipart/alternative</literal> type to display:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
First, Mutt will check the <command>alternative_order</command> list to
determine if one of the available types is preferred.  It consists of a
number of MIME types in order, including support for implicit and
explicit wildcards. For example:
</para>

<screen>
alternative_order text/enriched text/plain text \
  application/postscript image/*
</screen>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Next, Mutt will check if any of the types have a defined <link
linkend="auto-view"><command>auto_view</command></link>, and use that.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Failing that, Mutt will look for any text type.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
As a last attempt, Mutt will look for any type it knows how to handle.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
To remove a MIME type from the <command>alternative_order</command>
list, use the <command>unalternative_order</command> command.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="attachments">
<title>Attachment Searching and Counting</title>

<para>
If you ever lose track of attachments in your mailboxes, Mutt's
attachment-counting and -searching support might be for you.  You can
make your message index display the number of qualifying attachments in
each message, or search for messages by attachment count.  You also can
configure what kinds of attachments qualify for this feature with the
<command>attachments</command> and <command>unattachments</command>
commands.
</para>

<para>
In order to provide this information, Mutt needs to fully MIME-parse all
messages affected first. This can slow down operation especially for
remote mail folders such as IMAP because all messages have to be
downloaded first regardless whether the user really wants to view them
or not though using <xref linkend="body-caching"/> usually means to
download the message just once.
</para>

<para>
The syntax is:
</para>

<cmdsynopsis>
<command>attachments</command>
<arg choice="plain">
<replaceable>{ + | - }disposition</replaceable>

<arg choice="plain">
<replaceable>mime-type</replaceable>

</cmdsynopsis>

<para>
<emphasis>disposition</emphasis> is the attachment's Content-Disposition
type &mdash; either <literal>inline</literal> or
<literal>attachment</literal>.  You can abbreviate this to
<literal>I</literal> or <literal>A</literal>.
</para>

<para>
Disposition is prefixed by either a <quote>+</quote> symbol or a
<quote>-</quote> symbol.  If it's a <quote>+</quote>, you're saying that
you want to allow this disposition and MIME type to qualify.  If it's a
<quote>-</quote>, you're saying that this disposition and MIME type is
an exception to previous <quote>+</quote> rules.  There are examples
below of how this is useful.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>mime-type</emphasis> is the MIME type of the attachment you
want the command to affect.  A MIME type is always of the format
<literal>major/minor</literal>, where <literal>major</literal> describes
the broad category of document you're looking at, and
<literal>minor</literal> describes the specific type within that
category.  The major part of mime-type must be literal text (or the
special token <quote><literal>*</literal></quote>), but the minor part
may be a regular expression.  (Therefore,
<quote><literal>*/.*</literal></quote> matches any MIME type.)
</para>

<para>
The MIME types you give to the <command>attachments</command> directive
are a kind of pattern.  When you use the <command>attachments</command>
directive, the patterns you specify are added to a list.  When you use
<command>unattachments</command>, the pattern is removed from the list.
The patterns are not expanded and matched to specific MIME types at this
time &mdash; they're just text in a list.  They're only matched when
actually evaluating a message.
</para>

<para>
Some examples might help to illustrate.  The examples that are not
commented out define the default configuration of the lists.
</para>

<sect2 id="url-syntax">
<title>URL Syntax</title>

<para>
Mutt optionally supports the IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocols which require
to access servers using URLs. The canonical syntax for specifying URLs
in Mutt is (an item enclosed in <literal>[]</literal> means it is
optional and may be omitted):
</para>

<screen>
proto[s]://[username[:password]@]server[:port][/path]
</screen>

<para>
<emphasis>proto</emphasis> is the communication protocol:
<literal>imap</literal> for IMAP, <literal>pop</literal> for POP3 and
<literal>smtp</literal> for SMTP. If <quote>s</quote> for <quote>secure
communication</quote> is appended, Mutt will attempt to establish an
encrypted communication using SSL or TLS.
</para>

<para>
Since all protocols supported by Mutt support/require authentication,
login credentials may be specified in the URL. This has the advantage
that multiple IMAP, POP3 or SMTP servers may be specified (which isn't
possible using, for example, <link
linkend="imap-user">$imap_user</link>). The username may contain the
<quote>@</quote> symbol being used by many mail systems as part of the
login name. The special characters <quote>/</quote>
(<literal>%2F</literal>), <quote>:</quote> (<literal>%3A</literal>) and
<quote>%</quote> (<literal>%25</literal>) have to be URL-encoded in
usernames using the <literal>%</literal>-notation.
</para>

<para>
A password can be given, too but is not recommended if the URL is
specified in a configuration file on disk.
</para>

<para>
If no port number is given, Mutt will use the system's default for the
given protocol (usually consulting <literal>/etc/services</literal>).

<title>SSL/TLS Support</title>

<para>
If Mutt is compiled with IMAP, POP3 and/or SMTP support, it can also be
compiled with support for SSL or TLS using either OpenSSL or GnuTLS ( by
running the <emphasis>configure</emphasis> script with the
<emphasis>--enable-ssl=...</emphasis> option for OpenSSL or
<emphasis>--enable-gnutls=...</emphasis> for GnuTLS). Mutt can then
attempt to encrypt communication with remote servers if these protocols
are suffixed with <quote>s</quote> for <quote>secure
communication</quote>.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="pop">
<title>POP3 Support</title>

<para>
If Mutt is compiled with POP3 support (by running the
<emphasis>configure</emphasis> script with the
<emphasis>--enable-pop</emphasis> flag), it has the ability to work with
mailboxes located on a remote POP3 server and fetch mail for local
browsing.
</para>

<para>
Remote POP3 servers can be accessed using URLs with the
<literal>pop</literal> protocol for unencrypted and
<literal>pops</literal> for encrypted communication, see <xref
linkend="url-syntax"/> for details.
</para>

<para>
Polling for new mail is more expensive over POP3 than locally. For this
reason the frequency at which Mutt will check for mail remotely can be
controlled by the <link
linkend="pop-checkinterval">$pop_checkinterval</link> variable, which
defaults to every 60 seconds.
</para>

<para>
POP is read-only which doesn't allow for some features like editing
messages or changing flags. However, using <xref
linkend="header-caching"/> and <xref linkend="body-caching"/> Mutt
simulates the new/old/read flags as well as flagged and replied.  Mutt
applies some logic on top of remote messages but cannot change them so
that modifications of flags are lost when messages are downloaded from
the POP server (either by Mutt or other tools).
</para>

<anchor id="fetch-mail"/>
<para>
Another way to access your POP3 mail is the
<literal>&lt;fetch-mail&gt;</literal> function (default: G).  It allows
to connect to <link linkend="pop-host">$pop_host</link>, fetch all your
new mail and place it in the local <link
linkend="spoolfile">$spoolfile</link>.  After this point, Mutt runs
exactly as if the mail had always been local.
</para>

with folders located on a remote IMAP server.
</para>

<para>
You can access the remote inbox by selecting the folder by its URL (see
<xref linkend="url-syntax"/> for details) using the
<literal>imap</literal> or <literal>imaps</literal> protocol.
Alternatively, a pine-compatible notation is also supported, i.e.
<literal>{[username@]imapserver[:port][/ssl]}path/to/folder</literal>
</para>

<para>
Note that not all servers use <quote>/</quote> as the hierarchy
separator.  Mutt should correctly notice which separator is being used
by the server and convert paths accordingly.
</para>

<para>
When browsing folders on an IMAP server, you can toggle whether to look
at only the folders you are subscribed to, or all folders with the
<emphasis>toggle-subscribed</emphasis> command.  See also the <link
linkend="imap-list-subscribed">$imap_list_subscribed</link> variable.
</para>

<para>
Polling for new mail on an IMAP server can cause noticeable delays. So,
you'll want to carefully tune the <link
linkend="mail-check">$mail_check</link> and <link
linkend="timeout">$timeout</link> variables. Reasonable values are:
</para>

<screen>
set mail_check=90
set timeout=15
</screen>

<para>
with relatively good results even over slow modem lines.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Note that if you are using mbox as the mail store on UW servers prior to
v12.250, the server has been reported to disconnect a client if another
client selects the same folder.
</para>
</note>

<sect2 id="imap-browser">
<title>The IMAP Folder Browser</title>

<para>
As of version 1.2, Mutt supports browsing mailboxes on an IMAP
server. This is mostly the same as the local file browser, with the
following differences:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
In lieu of file permissions, Mutt displays the string
<quote>IMAP</quote>, possibly followed by the symbol <quote>+</quote>,
indicating that the entry contains both messages and subfolders. On
Cyrus-like servers folders will often contain both messages and
subfolders.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
For the case where an entry can contain both messages and subfolders,
the selection key (bound to <literal>enter</literal> by default) will
choose to descend into the subfolder view. If you wish to view the
messages in that folder, you must use <literal>view-file</literal>
instead (bound to <literal>space</literal> by default).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
You can create, delete and rename mailboxes with the
<literal>&lt;create-mailbox&gt;</literal>,
<literal>&lt;delete-mailbox&gt;</literal>, and
<literal>&lt;rename-mailbox&gt;</literal> commands (default bindings:
<literal>C</literal>, <literal>d</literal> and <literal>r</literal>,
respectively). You may also <literal>&lt;subscribe&gt;</literal> and
<literal>&lt;unsubscribe&gt;</literal> to mailboxes (normally these are
bound to <literal>s</literal> and <literal>u</literal>, respectively).
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="imap-authentication">
<title>Authentication</title>

<para>
Mutt supports four authentication methods with IMAP servers: SASL,
GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, and LOGIN (there is a patch by Grant Edwards to add
NTLM authentication for you poor exchange users out there, but it has
yet to be integrated into the main tree). There is also support for the
pseudo-protocol ANONYMOUS, which allows you to log in to a public IMAP
server without having an account. To use ANONYMOUS, simply make your
username blank or <quote>anonymous</quote>.
</para>

<para>
SASL is a special super-authenticator, which selects among several
protocols (including GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, ANONYMOUS, and DIGEST-MD5) the
most secure method available on your host and the server. Using some of
these methods (including DIGEST-MD5 and possibly GSSAPI), your entire
session will be encrypted and invisible to those teeming network
snoops. It is the best option if you have it. To use it, you must have
the Cyrus SASL library installed on your system and compile Mutt with
the <emphasis>--with-sasl</emphasis> flag.
</para>

<para>
Mutt will try whichever methods are compiled in and available on the
server, in the following order: SASL, ANONYMOUS, GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5,
LOGIN.
</para>

<para>
There are a few variables which control authentication:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
<link linkend="imap-user">$imap_user</link> - controls the username
under which you request authentication on the IMAP server, for all
authenticators. This is overridden by an explicit username in the
mailbox path (i.e. by using a mailbox name of the form
<literal>{user@host}</literal>).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<link linkend="imap-pass">$imap_pass</link> - a password which you may
preset, used by all authentication methods where a password is needed.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<link linkend="imap-authenticators">$imap_authenticators</link> - a
colon-delimited list of IMAP authentication methods to try, in the order
you wish to try them. If specified, this overrides Mutt's default
(attempt everything, in the order listed above).
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="smtp">
<title>SMTP Support</title>

<para>
Besides supporting traditional mail delivery through a
sendmail-compatible program, Mutt supports delivery through SMTP if it
was configured and built with <literal>--enable-smtp</literal>.
</para>

<para>
If the configuration variable <link linkend="smtp-url">$smtp_url</link>
is set, Mutt will contact the given SMTP server to deliver messages; if
it is unset, Mutt will use the program specified by <link
linkend="sendmail">$sendmail</link>.
</para>

<para>
For details on the URL syntax, please see <xref linkend="url-syntax"/>.
</para>

<para>
The built-in SMTP support supports encryption (the
<literal>smtps</literal> protocol using SSL or TLS) as well as SMTP
authentication using SASL. The authentication mechanisms for SASL are
specified in <link
linkend="smtp-authenticators">$smtp_authenticators</link> defaulting to
an empty list which makes Mutt try all available methods from
most-secure to least-secure.
</para>

<sect1 id="account-hook">
<title>Managing Multiple Accounts</title>

<arg choice="plain">
<replaceable class="parameter">regexp</replaceable>
</arg>
<arg choice="plain">
<replaceable class="parameter">command</replaceable>
</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>

<para>
If you happen to have accounts on multiple IMAP, POP and/or SMTP
servers, you may find managing all the authentication settings
inconvenient and error-prone. The <link
linkend="account-hook"><command>account-hook</command></link> command
may help. This hook works like <link
linkend="folder-hook"><command>folder-hook</command></link> but is
invoked whenever Mutt needs to access a remote mailbox (including inside
the folder browser), not just when you open the mailbox. This includes
(for example) polling for new mail, storing Fcc messages and saving
messages to a folder. As a consequence, <link
linkend="account-hook"><command>account-hook</command></link> should
only be used to set connection-related settings such as passwords or
tunnel commands but not settings such as sender address or name (because
in general it should be considered unpredictable which <link
linkend="account-hook"><command>account-hook</command></link> was last
used).
</para>

<para>
Some examples:
</para>

<screen>
account-hook . 'unset imap_user; unset imap_pass; unset tunnel'
account-hook imap://host1/ 'set imap_user=me1 imap_pass=foo'
account-hook imap://host2/ 'set tunnel="ssh host2 /usr/libexec/imapd"'
account-hook smtp://user@host3/ 'set tunnel="ssh host3 /usr/libexec/smtpd"'
</screen>

<para>
To manage multiple accounts with, for example, different values of <link
linkend="record">$record</link> or sender addresses, <link
linkend="folder-hook"><command>folder-hook</command></link> has to be be
used together with the <link
linkend="mailboxes"><command>mailboxes</command></link> command.
</para>

<example id="ex-multiaccount">
<title>Managing multiple accounts</title>
<screen>
mailboxes imap://user@host1/INBOX
folder-hook imap://user@host1/ 'set folder=imap://host1/ ; set record=+INBOX/Sent'

mailboxes imap://user@host2/INBOX
folder-hook imap://user@host2/ 'set folder=imap://host2/ ; set record=+INBOX/Sent'
</screen>
</example>

<para>
In example <xref linkend="ex-multiaccount"/> the folders are defined
using <link linkend="mailboxes"><command>mailboxes</command></link> so
Mutt polls them for new mail. Each <link
linkend="folder-hook"><command>folder-hook</command></link> triggers
when one mailbox below each IMAP account is opened and sets <link
linkend="folder">$folder</link> to the account's root folder. Next, it
sets <link linkend="record">$record</link> to the
<emphasis>INBOX/Sent</emphasis> folder below the newly set <link
linkend="folder">$folder</link>. Please notice that the value the
<quote>+</quote> <link linkend="shortcuts">mailbox shortcut</link>
refers to depends on the <emphasis>current</emphasis> value of <link
linkend="folder">$folder</link> and therefore has to be set separately
per account. Setting other values like <link linkend="from">$from</link>
or <link linkend="signature">$signature</link> is analogous to setting
<link linkend="record">$record</link>.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="caching">
<title>Local Caching</title>

<para>
Mutt contains two types of local caching: <emphasis>(1)</emphasis> the
so-called <quote>header caching</quote> and <emphasis>(2)</emphasis> the
so-called <quote>body caching</quote> which are both described in this
section.
</para>

<para>
Header caching is optional as it depends on external libraries, body
caching is always enabled if Mutt is compiled with POP and/or IMAP
support as these use it (body caching requires no external library).
</para>

<sect2 id="header-caching">
<title>Header Caching</title>

<para>
Mutt provides optional support for caching message headers for the
following types of folders: IMAP, POP, Maildir and MH. Header caching
greatly speeds up opening large folders because for remote folders,
headers usually only need to be downloaded once. For Maildir and MH,
reading the headers from a single file is much faster than looking at
possibly thousands of single files (since Maildir and MH use one file
per message.)
</para>

<para>
Header caching can be enabled via the configure script and the
<emphasis>--enable-hcache</emphasis> option. It's not turned on by
default because external database libraries are required: one of
tokyocabinet, qdbm, gdbm or bdb must be present.
</para>

<para>
If enabled, <link linkend="header-cache">$header_cache</link> can be
used to either point to a file or a directory. If set to point to a
file, one database file for all folders will be used (which may result
in lower performance), but one file per folder if it points to a
directory.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="body-caching">
<title>Body Caching</title>

<para>
Both cache methods can be combined using the same directory for storage
(and for IMAP/POP even provide meaningful file names) which simplifies
manual maintenance tasks.
</para>

<para>
In addition to caching message headers only, Mutt can also cache whole
message bodies. This results in faster display of messages for POP and
IMAP folders because messages usually have to be downloaded only once.
</para>

<para>
For configuration, the variable <link linkend="message-cachedir"
>$message_cachedir</link> must point to a directory. There, Mutt will
create a hierarchy of subdirectories named like the account and mailbox
path the cache is for.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="cache-dirs">
<title>Cache Directories</title>

<para>
For using both, header and body caching, <link
linkend="header-cache">$header_cache</link> and <link
linkend="message-cachedir" >$message_cachedir</link> can be safely set
to the same value.
</para>

<para>
In a header or body cache directory, Mutt creates a directory hierarchy
named like: <literal>proto:user@hostname</literal> where
<literal>proto</literal> is either <quote>pop</quote> or
<quote>imap.</quote> Within there, for each folder, Mutt stores messages
in single files and header caches in files with the
<quote>.hcache</quote> extension.  All files can be removed as needed if
the consumed disk space becomes an issue as Mutt will silently fetch
missing items again. Pathnames are always stored in UTF-8 encoding.
</para>

<para>
For Maildir and MH, the header cache files are named after the MD5
checksum of the path.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="maint-cache">
<title>Maintenance</title>

<para>
Mutt does not (yet) support maintenance features for header cache
database files so that files have to be removed in case they grow too
big. It depends on the database library used for header caching whether
disk space freed by removing messages is re-used.
</para>

<para>
For body caches, Mutt can keep the local cache in sync with the remote
mailbox if the <link
linkend="message-cache-clean">$message_cache_clean</link> variable is
set. Cleaning means to remove messages from the cache which are no
longer present in the mailbox which only happens when other mail clients
or instances of Mutt using a different body cache location delete
messages (Mutt itself removes deleted messages from the cache when
syncing a mailbox). As cleaning can take a noticeable amount of time, it
should not be set in general but only occasionally.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="exact-address">
<title>Exact Address Generation</title>

<para>
Mutt supports the <quote>Name &lt;user@host&gt;</quote> address syntax
for reading and writing messages, the older <quote>user@host
(Name)</quote> syntax is only supported when reading messages. The
<emphasis>--enable-exact-address</emphasis> switch can be given to
configure to build it with write-support for the latter
syntax. <literal>EXACT_ADDRESS</literal> in the output of <literal>mutt
-v</literal> indicates whether it's supported.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="sending-mixmaster">
<title>Sending Anonymous Messages via Mixmaster</title>

<para>
You may also have compiled Mutt to co-operate with Mixmaster, an
anonymous remailer.  Mixmaster permits you to send your messages
anonymously using a chain of remailers. Mixmaster support in Mutt is for
mixmaster version 2.04 or later.
</para>

<para>
To use it, you'll have to obey certain restrictions.  Most important,
you cannot use the <literal>Cc</literal> and <literal>Bcc</literal>
headers.  To tell Mutt to use mixmaster, you have to select a remailer
chain, using the mix function on the compose menu.
</para>

<para>
The chain selection screen is divided into two parts.  In the (larger)
upper part, you get a list of remailers you may use.  In the lower part,
you see the currently selected chain of remailers.
</para>

<para>
You can navigate in the chain using the
<literal>&lt;chain-prev&gt;</literal> and
<literal>&lt;chain-next&gt;</literal> functions, which are by default
bound to the left and right arrows and to the <literal>h</literal> and
<literal>l</literal> keys (think vi keyboard bindings).  To insert a
remailer at the current chain position, use the
<literal>&lt;insert&gt;</literal> function.  To append a remailer behind
the current chain position, use <literal>&lt;select-entry&gt;</literal>
or <literal>&lt;append&gt;</literal>.  You can also delete entries from
the chain, using the corresponding function.  Finally, to abandon your
changes, leave the menu, or <literal>&lt;accept&gt;</literal> them
pressing (by default) the <literal>Return</literal> key.
</para>

<para>
Note that different remailers do have different capabilities, indicated
in the %c entry of the remailer menu lines (see <link
linkend="mix-entry-format">$mix_entry_format</link>).  Most important is
the <quote>middleman</quote> capability, indicated by a capital
<quote>M</quote>: This means that the remailer in question cannot be
used as the final element of a chain, but will only forward messages to
other mixmaster remailers.  For details on the other capabilities,
please have a look at the mixmaster documentation.

<chapter id="security">
<title>Security Considerations</title>

<para>
First of all, Mutt contains no security holes included by intention but
may contain unknown security holes. As a consequence, please run Mutt
only with as few permissions as possible. Especially, do not run Mutt as
the super user.
</para>

<para>
When configuring Mutt, there're some points to note about secure setups
so please read this chapter carefully.
</para>

<sect1 id="security-passwords">
<title>Passwords</title>

<para>
Although Mutt can be told the various passwords for accounts, please
never store passwords in configuration files. Besides the fact that the
system's operator can always read them, you could forget to mask it out
when reporting a bug or asking for help via a mailing list. Even worse,
your mail including your password could be archived by internet search
engines, mail-to-news gateways etc. It may already be too late before
you notice your mistake.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="security-tempfiles">
<title>Temporary Files</title>

<para>
Mutt uses many temporary files for viewing messages, verifying digital
signatures, etc. As long as being used, these files are visible by other
users and maybe even readable in case of misconfiguration.  Also, a
different location for these files may be desired which can be changed
via the <link linkend="tmpdir">$tmpdir</link> variable.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="security-leaks">
<title>Information Leaks</title>

<sect2 id="security-leaks-mid">
<title>Message-Id: headers</title>

<para>
Message-Id: headers contain a local part that is to be created in a
unique fashion. In order to do so, Mutt will <quote>leak</quote> some
information to the outside world when sending messages: the generation
of this header includes a step counter which is increased (and rotated)
with every message sent. In a longer running mutt session, others can
make assumptions about your mailing habits depending on the number of
messages sent. If this is not desired, the header can be manually
provided using <link linkend="edit-headers">$edit_headers</link> (though
not recommended).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="security-leaks-mailto">
<title><literal>mailto:</literal>-style Links</title>

<para>
As Mutt be can be set up to be the mail client to handle
<literal>mailto:</literal> style links in websites, there're security
considerations, too. Arbitrary header fields can be embedded in these
links which could override existing header fields or attach arbitrary
files using <link linkend="attach-header">the Attach:
pseudoheader</link>. This may be problematic if the <link
linkend="edit-headers">$edit-headers</link> variable is
<emphasis>unset</emphasis>, i.e. the user doesn't want to see header
fields while editing the message and doesn't pay enough attention to the
compose menu's listing of attachments.
</para>

<para>
For example, following a link like
</para>

<screen>
mailto:joe@host?Attach=~/.gnupg/secring.gpg</screen>

<para>
will send out the user's private gnupg keyring to
<literal>joe@host</literal> if the user doesn't follow the information
on screen carefully enough.
</para>

<para>
To prevent these issues, Mutt by default only accepts the
<literal>Subject</literal> and <literal>Body</literal> headers.
Allowed headers can be adjusted with the
<link linkend="mailto-allow"><command>mailto_allow</command></link> and
<link linkend="mailto-allow"><command>unmailto_allow</command></link> commands.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="security-external">
<title>External Applications</title>

<para>
Mutt in many places has to rely on external applications or for
convenience supports mechanisms involving external applications.
</para>

<para>
One of these is the <literal>mailcap</literal> mechanism as defined by
RfC1524. Details about a secure use of the mailcap mechanisms is given
in <xref linkend="secure-mailcap"/>.
</para>

<para>
Besides the mailcap mechanism, Mutt uses a number of other external
utilities for operation, for example to provide crypto support, in
backtick expansion in configuration files or format string filters.  The
same security considerations apply for these as for tools involved via
mailcap.
</para>

<chapter id="tuning">
<title>Performance Tuning</title>

<sect1 id="tuning-mailboxes">
<title>Reading and Writing Mailboxes</title>

<para>
Mutt's performance when reading mailboxes can be improved in two ways:
</para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
For remote folders (IMAP and POP) as well as folders using one-file-per
message storage (Maildir and MH), Mutt's performance can be greatly
improved using <link linkend="header-caching">header caching</link>.
using a single database per folder.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Mutt provides the <link linkend="read-inc">$read_inc</link> and <link
linkend="write-inc">$write_inc</link> variables to specify at which rate
to update progress counters. If these values are too low, Mutt may spend
more time on updating the progress counter than it spends on actually
reading/writing folders.
</para>

<para>
For example, when opening a maildir folder with a few thousand messages,
the default value for <link linkend="read-inc">$read_inc</link> may be
too low. It can be tuned on on a folder-basis using <link
linkend="folder-hook"><command>folder-hook</command>s</link>:
</para>

<screen>
<emphasis role="comment"># use very high $read_inc to speed up reading hcache'd maildirs</emphasis>
folder-hook . 'set read_inc=1000'
<emphasis role="comment"># use lower value for reading slower remote IMAP folders</emphasis>
folder-hook ^imap 'set read_inc=100'
<emphasis role="comment"># use even lower value for reading even slower remote POP folders</emphasis>
folder-hook ^pop 'set read_inc=1'</screen>

</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
These settings work on a per-message basis. However, as messages may
greatly differ in size and certain operations are much faster than
others, even per-folder settings of the increment variables may not be
desirable as they produce either too few or too much progress updates.
Thus, Mutt allows to limit the number of progress updates per second
it'll actually send to the terminal using the <link
linkend="time-inc">$time_inc</link> variable.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="tuning-messages">
<title>Reading Messages from Remote Folders</title>

<para>
Reading messages from remote folders such as IMAP an POP can be slow
especially for large mailboxes since Mutt only caches a very limited
number of recently viewed messages (usually 10) per session (so that it
will be gone for the next session.)
</para>

<para>
To improve performance and permanently cache whole messages, please
refer to Mutt's so-called <link linkend="body-caching">body
caching</link> for details.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="tuning-search">
<title>Searching and Limiting</title>

<para>
When searching mailboxes either via a search or a limit action, for some
patterns Mutt distinguishes between regular expression and string
searches. For regular expressions, patterns are prefixed with
<quote>~</quote> and with <quote>=</quote> for string searches.
</para>

<para>
Even though a regular expression search is fast, it's several times
slower than a pure string search which is noticeable especially on large
folders. As a consequence, a string search should be used instead of a
regular expression search if the user already knows enough about the
search pattern.
</para>

<para>
For example, when limiting a large folder to all messages sent to or by
an author, it's much faster to search for the initial part of an e-mail
address via <literal>=Luser@</literal> instead of
<literal>~Luser@</literal>. This is especially true for searching
message bodies since a larger amount of input has to be searched.
</para>

<para>
As for regular expressions, a lower case string search pattern makes
Mutt perform a case-insensitive search except for IMAP (because for IMAP
Mutt performs server-side searches which don't support
case-insensitivity).
</para>

<para>
Mutt also supports a <quote>batch</quote> mode to send prepared
messages.  Simply redirect input from the file you wish to send.  For
example,
</para>

<screen>
mutt -s "data set for run #2" professor@bigschool.edu &lt; ~/run2.dat</screen>

<para>
will send a message to
<literal>&lt;professor@bigschool.edu&gt;</literal> with a subject of
<quote>data set for run #2</quote>.  In the body of the message will be
the contents of the file <quote>~/run2.dat</quote>.
</para>

<para>
An include file passed with <literal>-i</literal> will be used as the
body of the message.  When combined with <literal>-E</literal>, the
include file will be directly edited during message composition.  The
file will be modified regardless of whether the message is sent or
aborted.
</para>

<para>
A draft file passed with <literal>-H</literal> will be used as the
initial header and body for the message.  Multipart messages can be
used as a draft file.  When combined with <literal>-E</literal>, the
draft file will be updated to the final state of the message after
composition, regardless of whether the message is sent, aborted, or
even postponed.  Note that if the message is sent encrypted or signed,
the draft file will be saved that way too.
</para>

<para>
All files passed with <literal>-a</literal> <emphasis>file</emphasis>
will be attached as a MIME part to the message. To attach a single or
several files, use <quote>--</quote> to separate files and recipient
addresses:
</para>

<screen>
mutt -a image.png -- some@one.org</screen>

<para>
or
</para>

<screen>
mutt -a *.png -- some@one.org</screen>

<note>
<para>
The <literal>-a</literal> option must be last in the option list.
</para>
</note>

<para>
In addition to accepting a list of email addresses, Mutt also accepts a URL with
the <literal>mailto:</literal> schema as specified in RFC2368.  This is useful
when configuring a web browser to launch Mutt when clicking on mailto links.
</para>

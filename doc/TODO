Documentation TODO in no particular order grouped by style and content.

It would be nice to get some of these done for 1.6.

Style/Technical
---------------

* Re-check complete manual for consistency. The same things need to be
  consistently marked up, e.g. an item either always as <literal/> or
  always <emphasis/> (decide clearly which to use for what), make sure
  all option refs are links, things are consistently quoted.
  E.g. it has:

    If the filename begins with a tilde (``&tilde;'')

  and

    If the filename ends with a vertical bar (&verbar;)

  We need to choose either style and use it.

* Think about some way of templating to a) help improve consistency
  (i.e. some sort of macro to refer to key, options, functions, etc.)
  and b) reduce typing overhead.

    <link linkend="pipe-split">&dollar;pipe&lowbar;split</link>

  is neither fun to read nor to write. This would give us lots of
  options to improve it (e.g. an automated index). We depend on
  perl already to build docs, think about/look for simple perl
  templating engine.

* Find a way (XSLT?) to trim the TOC for the option reference; it's
  ugly but we probably want to keep the TOC depth as-is for other
  sections.

Content
-------

* Some sections maybe should be better grouped by topic, instead of
  one section per task (e.g. hooks should be grouped under a section
  'hooks' in the config chapter).

* Talk a lot more about character sets and encodings.

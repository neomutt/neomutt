#. %s is a directory.  NeoMutt is looking for a directory it needs
#. for some reason (e.g. autocrypt, header cache, bcache), but it
#. doesn't exist.  The prompt is asking whether to create the directory
#.

#. L10N:
#. The first time NeoMutt is started with $autocrypt set, it will

#. account with this message.
#.
#: autocrypt/autocrypt.c:165
msgid "Create an initial autocrypt account?"
msgstr "Create an initial autocrypt account?"

#. L10N:
#. Autocrypt is asking for the email address to use for the
#. autocrypt account.  This will generate a key and add a record
#. to the database for use in autocrypt operations.
#.
#: autocrypt/autocrypt.c:189
msgid "Autocrypt account address: "
msgstr "Autocrypt account address: "

#. L10N:
#. Autocrypt prompts for an account email address, and requires
#. a single address.  This is shown if they entered something invalid,
#. nothing, or more than one address for some reason.
#.
#: autocrypt/autocrypt.c:200
msgid "Please enter a single email address"

#: autocrypt/autocrypt.c:217
msgid "That email address already has an autocrypt account"
msgstr "That email address already has an autocrypt account"

#. L10N:
#. Autocrypt has a setting "prefer-encrypt".
#. When the recommendation algorithm returns "available" and BOTH
#. sender and recipient choose "prefer-encrypt", encryption will be
#. automatically enabled.
#. Otherwise the UI will show encryption is "available" but the user
#. will be required to enable encryption manually.

#. L10N:
#. %s is an email address.  Autocrypt is scanning for the keyids
#. to use to encrypt, but it can't find a valid keyid for this address.

msgid "No (valid) autocrypt key found for %s"
msgstr "No (valid) autocrypt key found for %s"

#. L10N:
#. The first time autocrypt is enabled, NeoMutt will ask to scan
#. through one or more mailboxes for Autocrypt: headers.
#. Those headers are then captured in the database as peer records
#. and used for encryption.
#. If this is answered yes, they will be prompted for a mailbox.

msgstr "Scan a mailbox for autocrypt headers?"

#. L10N: The prompt for a mailbox to scan for Autocrypt: headers
#: autocrypt/autocrypt.c:916
msgid "Scan mailbox"
msgstr "Scan mailbox"

#. L10N:
#. This is the second prompt to see if the user would like
#. to scan more than one mailbox for Autocrypt headers.
#. I'm purposely being extra verbose; asking first then prompting
#. for a mailbox.  This is because this is a one-time operation
#. and I don't want them to accidentally ctrl-g and abort it.
#.
#: autocrypt/autocrypt.c:936
msgid "Scan another mailbox for autocrypt headers?"

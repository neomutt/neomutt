#: autocrypt/autocrypt.c:163
msgid "Create an initial autocrypt account?"
msgstr "Create an initial autocrypt account?"

#. L10N:
#. Autocrypt is asking for the email address to use for the

#. to the database for use in autocrypt operations.
#.
#: autocrypt/autocrypt.c:187
msgid "Autocrypt account address: "

#. L10N:

msgid "That email address already has an autocrypt account"
msgstr "That email address already has an autocrypt account"

#. L10N:
#. Autocrypt has a setting "prefer-encrypt".
#. When the recommendation algorithm returns "available" and BOTH
#. sender and recipient choose "prefer-encrypt", encryption will be
#. automatically enabled.
#. Otherwise the UI will show encryption is "available" but the user
#. will be required to enable encryption manually.

#. L10N:
#. The first time autocrypt is enabled, NeoMutt will ask to scan
#. through one or more mailboxes for Autocrypt: headers.
#. Those headers are then captured in the database as peer records
#. and used for encryption.
#. If this is answered yes, they will be prompted for a mailbox.

msgid "Scan mailbox"
msgstr "Scan mailbox"

#. L10N:
#. This is the second prompt to see if the user would like
#. to scan more than one mailbox for Autocrypt headers.
#. I'm purposely being extra verbose; asking first then prompting
#. for a mailbox.  This is because this is a one-time operation
#. and I don't want them to accidentally ctrl-g and abort it.
#.

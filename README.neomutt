## What is NeoMutt?

* NeoMutt is a project of projects.
* A place to gather all the patches against Mutt.
* A place for all the developers to gather.

Hopefully this will build the community and reduce duplicated effort.

NeoMutt was created when Richard Russon (FlatCap) took all the old Mutt patches,
sorted through them, fixed them up and documented them.

	* curs_main.c, pager.c, protos.h: Clear pager position upon returning
	to the index menu.

	This fixes a bug where opening a message sometimes shows it scrolled
	down.

	The easiest way to trigger this is to open a long message in a
	mailbox with no new messages, scroll down, hit <next-new-then-
	unread> and then reopen the message. The pager will "remember" the
	position and scroll down. If you simply exit the message and re-
	enter it, the position is not saved.

	More annoyingly, once in a very great while I will open a new
	message and have the message scrolled down partway. I believe this
	is due to OldHdr happening to point to the same address as the
	Header of the new message.

	This is somewhat easily triggered on a mailbox with one message,
	which you open, scroll down in, hit <next-new-then-unread> to exit,
	and then delete/sync. In another mutt instance, copy the same
	messsage back to the mailbox, then open the message in the original
	mutt instance. At least some of the time, the OldHdr pointer matches
	the new message, and so it opens scrolled down.

	This patch solves the problem by clearing the pager position once
	all redirections through the index menu are done.

	* rfc2047.c: Remove nonsensical size check in mutt_choose_charset()

	The charsets parameter is being tokenized by the : delimeter.

	The checks against ENCWORD_LEN_MAX and ENCWORD_LEN_MIN make no
	sense, and appear to be the result of a large merge a very long time
	ago (changeset cb27682966d5).

	I can only guess where this check was supposed to be, but it
	certainly doesn't belong here.

	* mx.c: Use the ctx->mx_ops instead of calling mx_get_ops()

	With mx_open_mailbox_append() setting the ctx->mx_ops, all contexts
	should have mx_ops set.

	Remove calls to mx_get_ops() and instead directly use ctx->mx_ops.

2016-08-01 18:25 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e778db6e693c)

	* mailbox.h, mh.c, mx.c: Use a different flag in
	mx_open_mailbox_append() when mailbox doesn't exist.

	The previous commit re-used MUTT_NEWFOLDER, but the meaning of that
	flag is slightly different: it causes mbox to use fopen with mode
	"w", and is used only for the case of a brand-new mktemp-generated
	mbox.

	Setting it for other non-existing mbox files leads to a race
	condition between the stat and the fopen/lock, and so could end up
	truncating an existing mailbox created in-between!

	Create a different flag, MUTT_APPENDNEW to notify the open_append()
	functions that the mailbox doesn't exist. Change maildir and mh to
	check for that flag to create their directory structures.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, pop.c: Convert
	mx_open_mailbox_append() to use ctx->mx_ops.

	Set the flag MUTT_NEWFOLDER to signal Maildir and MH to create the
	directory structure.

	Distribute the "open append" code to mbox, mh, and imap/imap.c.

	Set pop's mx_ops handler to NULL to signal it is not supported.

2016-07-31 18:42 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (3834da0c024e)

	* mbox.c, mx.c: Move fflush and fsync to the mbox and mmdf commit_msg
	functions.

	The case statement in mx_commit_message() was previously distributed
	to the various ops->commit_msg() handlers, but the fflush and fsync
	were not.

2016-07-30 11:11 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (27b77b5c97cf)

	* browser.c, browser.h, imap/browse.c, imap/imap.h, init.h: Add unread
	and total message count format strings to $folder_format.

	%n will show the unread message count in the mailbox. %m will show
	total message count. Except for %n with IMAP, these both require
	$mail_check_stats to be set, which puts these counts inside BUFFY.

	Since the imap_mboxcache is never fresher than the value in BUFFY,
	remove the special imap_mailbox_state() call. Instead, just update
	from the current Context for all mailboxes.

	Remove the logic that overrode the %N format string to show unread
	count for IMAP mailboxes. If they want to see unread count, they
	will have to change the $folder_format.

	Although it doesn't look possible to reuse browser_state.entry
	slots, change the OP_DELETE_MAILBOX to memset(0) the deleted slot.
	Then, we can change to logic in add_folder() so it doesn't need to
	zero-out unset values.

2016-07-25 12:25 -0700  Richard Russon  <rich@flatcap.org>  (4f4c258ab95c)

	* imap/command.c: Fix imap buffy msg_count overwrite issue.

	The sidebar updates the buffy->msg_count with the context. This can
	cause it to become out of sync with the imap_mboxcache.

	If the imap_buffy doesn't request MESSAGES, don't overwrite the
	buffy->msg_count with a stale value.

2016-07-22 14:55 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7b9763564598)

	* buffy.c, mx.c: Convert buffy_mbox_check() and trash_append() to use
	local context.

	buffy_mbox_check() was leaking the dynamically allocated context.
	Rather than add a call to free, just convert it to use a local
	variable.

	Make the same change to trash_append(), which doesn't need the
	dynamically allocated context either.

2016-07-19 18:56 -0700  Anton Lindqvist  <anton.lindqvist@gmail.com>  (69bbe4da959f)

	* curs_lib.c: Fix arithmetic exception due to menu->pagelen being
	negative.

	Resizing the terminal window down to two lines when in an empty
	mailbox causes mutt to crash due to division by zero since menu->max
	equals 0 and menu->pagelen < 0 in status.c:205.

	Fixing the problem at this specific line felt wrong since I did
	notice menu->pagelen being negative. The pagelen is inherited from
	the rows calculation in mutt_reflow_windows. Since the number of
	lines can potentially be smaller than the accumulated number of rows
	acquired by the status, help and message window, make sure the
	calculation does not turn negative.

2016-07-17 19:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f1d5a884ffed)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mutt.h, mx.c: Add imap-fast-trash patch.

	This is based on the patch by Paul Miller.

	Modifications are:

	* Create a new flag, MUTT_TRASH for imap_make_msg_set(), rather than
	use MUTT_EXPIRED.

	* Change imap_make_msg_set(MUTT_TRASH) to only look at
	hdrs[n]->deleted && !hdrs[n]->purge, behaving like MUTT_TAG, rather
	than looking at the HEADER_DATA.

	* Reimplement imap_fast_trash() based on imap_copy_message(). It
	looks the old version was too, but it lacked handling of TRYCREATE
	and also queued the UID COPY but didn't exec it. (Presumably this
	happened in the subsequent sync).

	* Move the Context magic and mx_is_imap() checks outside of
	imap_fast_trash()

	* OPS, curs_main.c, functions.h, pager.c: Add purge-message patch.

	This is based on the patch by Cedric Duval. Modifications are:

	* Use the exising M_PURGE flag from the trash folder patch, rather
	than adding a separate flag.

	* Undelete operations are already handled by the trash folder patch.

	imap/message.c, init.h, mbox.c, mutt.h, mx.c, pager.c, pattern.c,
	postpone.c: Add the trash folder patch.

	This is based on the trash folder patch by Cedric Duval.
	Modifications to the original patch are:

	* Use a flag called M_PURGE instead of M_APPENDED. The same flag is
	then used in the following "purge" patch instead of adding a
	different flag.

	* Removed the counter in context. The existing context->deleted is
	all that's needed.

	* Removed the "auto unset M_PURGE" when M_DELETED is unset inside
	_mutt_set_flag(), although this is convenient, it easily leads to
	header->purge not being reset in a few situations.

	* Reset purge flag along with the deleted flag if $delete is
	answered no.

	* Set M_PURGE on an edited message. (edit_one_message())

	* Preserve purge flag in mutt_reopen_mailbox()

	* Turn off OPTCONFIRMAPPEND when saving to the trash, rather than
	hardcoding it off in mutt_save_confirm(). That way, normal save to
	the folder will respect the option.

	* mutt_sasl.c: Fix memory leak in mutt_sasl_cb_pass.

	SASL doesn't free the sasl_secret_t, so this was leaking. Instead,
	keep our own pointer to it, and safe_realloc() each time.

	sasl_secret_t doesn't need the data field null terminated, so memcpy
	the password over.

2016-07-12 18:04 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (488f91a85115)

	* muttlib.c, sendlib.c: Fix BODY->d_filename memory leaks.

	mutt_message_to_7bit() and transform_to_7bit() were overwriting
	d_filename without freeing the previous value.

	mutt_free_body() was not freeing the d_filename pointer.

	* muttlib.c, sendlib.c: Fix BODY->charset memory leaks.

	mutt_get_content_info() was directly setting charset without freeing
	the previous value.

	mutt_free_body() was not freeing the charset.

2016-07-11 18:36 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (9378d21fc7fe)

	* curs_lib.c, main.c: Initialize mutt windows even in batch mode.
	(closes #3853)

	mutt_select_fcc() calls mutt_addr_hook() -> mutt_make_string() which
	refers to MuttIndexWindow->cols when calling mutt_FormatString(). In
	batch mode, MuttIndexWindow hasn't been initialized, leading to a
	segfault.

	This might be the only overlap, but it seems wiser to just
	initialize the mutt windows in case there are other references (now
	or in the future) when processing format strings in batch mode.

	* sidebar.c: Change sidebar highlighted mailbox behavior.

	Delay selecting the highlighted mailbox until prepare_mailbox(), to
	avoid a hidden mailbox being selected during the Buffy list
	population (in mutt_sb_notify_mailbox()).

	Change update_entries_visibility() to not automatically make the
	highlighted mailbox visible.

	Change prepare_sidebar() to (re)set the highlighted mailbox when the
	current highlighted mailbox is hidden.

2016-07-08 18:52 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5fb53b95afa7)

	* sidebar.c: Fix sidebar pagedown/up when mailboxes on the end are
	hidden.

	The pageup/pagedown code was setting the highlighted mailbox to the
	top and bottom index without checking if those were hidden.

2016-07-08 18:47 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4dc1831fd6d7)

	* imap/message.c: Don't overwrite imap_status->uidnext with a lower
	value. (closes #3771)

	imap_read_headers() updates the idata and imap_status uidnext after
	reading through all the new headers.

	The idata is updated properly (only if its uidnext is below
	maxuid+1), but the imap_status was always being set to maxuid.

	This causes a problem with new mail checking if the most recent
	messages are deleted. Then the uidnext will be greater than maxuid+1
	in the mailbox, and if there are any other unread messages it will
	*always* report new mail even if $mail_check_recent is set.

2016-07-07 12:00 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (6f2fe8f32dab)

	* sidebar.c: Fix the sidebar TopIndex and BotIndex when
	$sidebar_new_mail_only is set.

	When set, some of the entries can be hidden, so a simple division by
	page_size to find the correct top/bottom isn't correct.

	Instead, manually partition into groups of page_size visible entries
	and set top and bottom based on the interval around the highlighted
	entry.

2016-07-07 09:21 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5229c7fbc37e)

	* sidebar.c: Fix sidebar "unsorted" order to match Buffy list order.

	Since the previous commit decoupled the sidebar from the Buffy list,
	we can now restore the order to match the buffy list when
	sidebar_sort_method is set (back) to "unsorted".

2016-07-02 12:22 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b05c170b4c91)

	* buffy.h, sidebar.c: Decouple the sidebar from the Buffy list.

	Change the sidebar to use an array of SBENTRY* instead. Move the
	"is_hidden" into SBENTRY. Remove the added "prev" pointer from
	BUFFY.

	This way, sorting the sidebar doesn't affect the BUFFY list order,
	and we don't need elements inside BUFFY just for the sidebar
	presentation.

	Fix sidebar-next for the case where the mailboxes are unsorted and
	$sidebar_new_mail_only is set. Change sorting not to clump hidden
	mailboxes at the bottom, instead simply skip over hidden mailboxes
	in sidebar-next/prev.

	When krb5-config was found, MUTT_AM_PATH_GSSAPI included CFLAGS in
	GSSAPI_CFLAGS and MUTTLIBS in GSSAPI_LIBS. However, configure.ac
	afterwards sets: CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $GSSAPI_CFLAGS"

	Thanks to Fabian Groffen for reporting this issue and providing a
	couple possible patches. From Fabian's report:

	 For some time now, ncurses can be built in a mode where the low
	level terminfo functionality lives in a separate lib called
	libtinfo. Because some people do, this means Mutt needs to include
	this library in that case to avoid linking errors [...]

	The $sidebar_refresh_time option was removed with the changeset

	* buffy.c, buffy.h, curs_main.c, imap/imap.c, main.c, mutt.h, mx.c,
	pop.c, sidebar.c, sidebar.h: Change sidebar to consistently use
	realpath for context and buffy comparison.

	The original sidebar patch contained a half-implemented attempt to
	use realpath() mailbox paths for comparison. (Presumably so the open
	mailbox remains highlighted despite symlink issues).

	Add realpath to the Context, and set it when opening a mailbox.
	Remove sidebar ifdef for the buffy member, and always set it there
	too.

	Change the sidebar to use the realpath for comparison everywhere.

	mutt_buffy_check() is using stat device and inode for comparison.
	Perhaps this can be changed to use realpath instead, but that's
	beyond the scope of this patch.

2016-06-22 09:20 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c8613259dc38)

	mx.c, mx.h: add commit_msg to struct mx_ops

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (28688fee52a5)

	* mbox.c, mx.c, mx.h: add mmdf_commit_message function

	Move MMDF operations that were done in mx_commit_message to a
	dedicated mmdf_commit_message function.

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (4c6539a88f0a)

	* mbox.c, mx.c, mx.h: add mbox_commit_message function

	Move mbox operations that were done in mx_commit_message to a
	dedicated mbox_commit_message function.

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (16bfe31ef8b3)

	* imap/imap.h, imap/message.c, mx.c: add imap_commit_message function

	Move IMAP operations that were done in mx_commit_message to a
	dedicated imap_commit_message function.

	* mh.c, mx.c, mx.h: add maildir_commit_message function

	This commit adds a maildir_commit_message with a prototype
	consistent with other kind of mailboxes, to simplify upcoming
	refactoring.

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (93d4169b0886)

	* mh.c, mx.c, mx.h: prepend maildir_commit_message function name with
	an underscore

	Basically, rename maildir_commit_message to _maildir_commit_message.
	This commit is preparatory to make the maildir_commit_message symbol
	available for further use.

	Symbols starting with underscore should be avoided but this one is
	long enough to prevent collision.

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (e5d87ebe0f5b)

	* mh.c, mx.c, mx.h: remove unused HEADER parameter in
	mh_commit_message

	mh_commit_message is only called in one place with the header
	parameter set to NULL. To make the commit function consistent with
	other mailboxes, which only takes ctx and msg as parameters, remove
	this unused parameter.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c, mbox.c, mh.c,
	mutt.h, mx.c, pop.c: add close_msg to struct mx_ops

2016-06-18 12:41 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (4bab14a24dbe)

	* mailbox.h, mx.c: Remove magic member in MESSAGE structure

	The "magic" was copied from the context to the message structure to
	be able to determine which close function had to be called in
	mx_close_message. Now that this function is context aware, there is
	no need to store the magic in the MESSAGE structure and it can be
	safely removed.

2016-06-18 12:41 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (3ec6c133641c)

	* attach.c, commands.c, copy.c, editmsg.c, mailbox.h, mh.c, mx.c,
	parse.c, pattern.c, pop.c, postpone.c, recvattach.c, sendlib.c: pass
	context in mx_close_message

	The mx_close_message is one of the few mx_* functions that don't
	have a context as parameter. To make them more consistent, pass the
	context.

2016-06-17 19:01 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (70eb7e0dbb58)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c,
	mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, pop.c, pop.h: Add open_msg to struct
	mx_ops

	Add the callback to open an existing message to struct mx_ops. For
	mbox, mmdf, maildir, and mh, the code was implemented directly into
	mx_open_message, so it is moved in their respective source files.
	For imap and pop, there were already <mailbox>_fetch_message
	functions, but their argument order has been changed to pass the
	context as a first argument.

2016-06-17 10:33 -0700  Olaf Hering  <olaf@aepfle.de>  (d83239fd794a)

	* browser.c, browser.h: folder_file: remove struct stat

	Add and use new flag to indicate the folder is on local filesystem.
	Add and use new gid, uid and nlink member. Use existing ->mode
	member instead of stat->st_mode. Use existing ->size member instead
	of stat->st_size. Use existing ->mtime member instead of
	stat->st_mtime. Remove struct stat, the used values were already
	duplicated in the struct. This reduces memory usage.

2016-06-17 10:33 -0700  Olaf Hering  <olaf@aepfle.de>  (8e671bbe094d)

	* regex.c: Add real prototype for re_match_2_internal in regex.c

	Fixes compilation warning with -Wunprototyped-calls

2016-06-17 10:30 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5817d3d93b7a)

	* buffy.c, buffy.h, mh.c, mx.h: Combine the basic and extended buffy
	functions.

	Add a check_stats parameter to the mbox, maildir, and mh buffy
	functions. Use that parameter to determine whether to also count
	total, new, and flagged messages.

	This makes the functions a bit more complicated, but improves
	efficiency (for maildir and mh).

	Also includes the following cleanup/fixes:
	* Move the orig-value counter reset to the beginnining of the loop,
	(before tmp->new is set to 0).

	* Change trashed maildir messages to not be counted in msg_count

	* Remove an incorrect setting of mailbox->new based on msg_count in
	maildir. (I missed this one for 1f840760e6e0)

	* Change mbox to use the context->mtime for stats_last_checked,
	removing a race condition.

	* Fix mh to actually count the messages in order to generate
	msg_count. mh_sequences only covers the range of messages with some
	sort of flag.

2016-06-15 11:09 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (c29c521eec0a)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2016-06-14 13:11 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5ad82360c6ea)

	* imap/imap.c: Reset buffy->new for the current mailbox in IMAP.

	1f840760e6e0 moved the buffy->new reset inside the STATUS processor.
	Since the current mailbox is not STATUS'ed, it needs to be reset in
	imap_buffy_check().

	Thanks to Aaron Schrab for reporting this issue (and for helping
	test tip).

2016-06-12 13:49 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f447c67f511b)

	* OPS.MIX, OPS.SIDEBAR: Fix the case of messages in OPS.MIX and
	OPS.SIDEBAR

	Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for spotting the discrepancy.

2016-06-07 15:02 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1f840760e6e0)

	* buffy.c, buffy.h, contrib/sample.muttrc-sidebar,
	doc/manual.xml.head, globals.h, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap.h, init.h, mailbox.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, mx.h,
	sidebar.c, sidebar.h: Make extended buffy independent of the
	sidebar.

	Add new boolean option $mail_check_stats (default off) and
	$mail_check_stats_interval. The first turns extended buffy on. The
	second sets the amount of time in between extended buffy checks
	(defaulting to 60 seconds).

	Remove the option $sidebar_refresh_time.

	Change mutt_buffy_check() to only notify the sidebar to redraw if a
	mailbox buffy value changes.

	Remove the #ifdefs around the extended buffy functions. The next
	patch will merge these functions with the basic functions and pass a
	parameter instead.

	Imap is a special case, because it sends out the status in one
	batch. Change this to perform the comparisons inside
	cmd_parse_status() and flag the sidebar there. It was previously
	directly assigning the status counters (unsigned int) to the
	buffy->new (short). Change this to assign 1/0.

2016-06-08 14:43 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4be8b077c81f)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Change the default for sidebar_format
	to use %n.

	The next series of patches is going to create a new option,
	$mail_check_stats defaulting off. When off, the extended buffy which
	calculates total/new/flagged messages won't be run. To help reduce
	"sidebar is broken" bug reports, this changes the default format to
	something not requiring extended buffy.

	The previous default is documented in the option and preserved in
	the sample sidebar muttrc in contrib.

2016-06-08 13:16 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (594137a8ea12)

	* init.h, sidebar.c: Add sidebar_format flag '%n' to display 'N' on
	new mail.

2016-06-11 17:59 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (123e36398eea)

2016-06-09 12:06 -0700  Richard Russon  <rich@flatcap.org>  (93c4ae03689e)

	* compose.c: Fix alignment in the compose menu.

	Several of the compose-panel labels didn't use the TITLE_FMT to
	align themselves. This causes formatting problems when the width is
	changed, e.g. by the NNTP patch.

2016-06-08 13:28 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (1fad3bfd4aab)

	* Makefile.am: Corrected OPS.SIDEBAR filename in EXTRA_DIST.

2016-06-07 13:40 -0700  Richard Russon  <rich@flatcap.org>  (fc33b34d637b)

	* sidebar.c: Setting $sidebar_width to more than 128 would cause bad
	things to happen.

	First, give the users more than enough space. Second, don't pad out
	short strings beyond the buffer

2016-06-07 13:27 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (9937540dab42)

	* commands.c, hdrline.c, pager.c, protos.h, status.c: Fix columns used
	for $status_format and $pager_format in the pager.

	The code was hardcoding use of MuttIndexWindow->cols in
	mutt_make_string_info() and MuttStatusWindow->cols in
	menu_status_line().

	Add a parameter to mutt_make_info_string(). Change
	menu_status_line() to use menu->statuswin->cols, falling back to
	MuttStatusWindow if no menu is passed in.

	Set menu->statuswin appropriately inside pager.c.

	Thanks to Richard Russon for tracking down this problem, and for the
	initial patch.

2016-06-05 18:30 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5270cd795043)

	* doc/makedoc.c: Add warning in makedoc for unexpected prefices. (see
	#3845)

	In case other types get renamed again in the future, add a warning
	message to makedoc.c.

2016-06-05 18:05 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (91608dca6f12)

	* mx.c: Fix sidebar buffy stats updating on mailbox close.

	Move the mutt_sb_set_buffystats() call from mx_fastclose_mailbox()
	to the bottom of mx_close_mailbox(). Append-only mailboxes don't
	have msgcount set, so fastclose was the wrong place to be doing
	these updates.

2016-06-04 11:32 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (8e342d73159b)

	* buffy.c, mh.c: Start to fix sidebar buffy modifications.

	The extended buffy for mh had incorrect placement of the loop
	brackets. The counters weren't being incremented in the loop.

	Fix extended buffy for maildir to count a maildir message as new if
	it doesn't have the info delimeter.

	Remove shortcircuits added to the basic buffy stating there is new
	mail when (msg_unread > 0). This is not necessarily true, depending
	on $mail_check_recent.

	Note: the extended buffy still needs more fixes, which will be done
	when it is refactored into its own option.

2016-06-04 11:32 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5d117fd810a9)

	* sidebar.c: Various fixes to the sidebar logic.

	Use strfcpy instead of strncpy. The current logic could write past
	the end of the buffer.

	Don't mess with BUFFY next pointers during removal. The
	mutt_parse_mailboxes() is fine, but this is still not something that
	should be done inside sidebar.c.

	On removal, set next->prev since we can.

	Fix unmailboxes logic:
	  * only fix the prev pointers once.
	  * if we unmailbox the open mailbox, set it to NULL.

	Lastly, flag a redraw on mailboxes/unmailboxes.

2016-06-04 11:32 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b542812c262e)

	* buffy.c, curs_main.c, main.c, menu.c, mx.c, pager.c, sidebar.c,
	sidebar.h: Add "mutt_" prefix to global sidebar functions.

	Also, remove unused sb_init declaration.

2016-06-04 11:32 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cb23ed20d035)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Clean up the sidebar manual.

	Remove the introduction section. It's a nice effort, but reads more
	like a tutorial than something that belongs in section 2. Will
	probably put in on the website instead.

	Remove references to a "patch", neomutt, and the history.

	Remove the sample muttrc from the manual.

	Fix validation errors for the documentation.

2016-06-04 11:32 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (517d4f0debab)

	* Makefile.am, buffy.c, configure.ac, curs_main.c, flags.c, globals.h,
	keymap.c, menu.c, mutt_menu.h, pager.c, sidebar.c: Sidebar clean up:
	building and drawing logic.

	Fix the autoconf/makefile.am changes to be consistent.

	Create a global SidebarNeedsRedraw to indicate a redraw is needed,
	instead of putting sb_draw() everywhere in the code.

	Create a menu_redraw_sidebar() function and use the REDRAW_SIDEBAR
	flag instead of piggy-backing it inside the index loop.

	Fix curs_main.c and pager.c to be a bit cleaner by using the global
	and REDRAW_SIDEBAR.

	Start to clean up some of the buffy code, but this needs to
	refactored and fixed.

	* doc/makedoc.c: Fix documentation for DT_MAGIC types. (closes #3845)

	With the rename of M_ to MUTT_, the documentation generator in

	Thanks to Damien Riegel for the suggested fix.

2016-05-26 14:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cd316a555bd7)

	* copy.h, group.h, mailbox.h, mutt.h, mutt_curses.h, pager.h: Fix
	header file indentation after M_ prefix renaming.

	The use of tabs caused misalignment of various macro definitions.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, mx.h, pop.c,
	pop.h: add check operation to struct mx_ops

	In mx_check_mailbox switch case, we simply call
	<mailbox>_check_mailbox, so this operation can be move into the
	mx_ops structure pretty easily.

	This commit adds a mandatory "check" operation to struct mx_ops and
	change all mailboxes to use it. Check functions are made static as
	they are only used in their respective source files now.

2016-05-26 14:05 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien@riegel.io>  (a28ed1c725c6)

	* curs_main.c, mailbox.h, mx.c: mx_check_mailbox: remove lock argument
	in function call

	This function is only called in one place with lock = 0. Basically,
	all code under if (lock) is dead code, so we can remove it, making
	the function simpler to factorize.

2016-05-26 14:05 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien@riegel.io>  (0ae29df8a81a)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mx.c: add function
	imap_check_mailbox_reopen

	In mx_check_mailbox, imap mailbox is the only function with a
	different prototype: it has an extra force argument.

	In order to move the check operation to the mx_ops structure, we
	need that all mailboxes have the same prototype. To do so, a new
	function imap_check_mailbox_reopen is added.

2016-05-25 15:58 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (261939e71d80)

	* mx.c: Add a TODO to mx_open_new_message() to use mx_ops in the
	future.

	We can't use it until mx_open_mailbox_append() is converted to set
	mx_ops.

2016-05-25 15:53 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien@riegel.io>  (63cb99b46c34)

	* imap/imap.c, mailbox.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, mx.h: add
	open_new_msg operation to struct mx_ops

	The code was already using a function pointer to do this operation.
	This commit moves this function pointer to the mx_ops structure and
	the open_new_message functions to their respective source files if
	it needs to.

2016-05-24 12:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (79c379cb0c21)

2016-05-12 12:41 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (ae203b2c56a6)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, mx.h, pop.c,
	pop.h: Start decoupling mailbox operations.

	Introduce a dedicated structure for mailbox operations: struct
	mx_ops. Move the open and close operations into that structure.

	Assign this structure to the context in mx_open_mailbox. This is
	currently based on the "magic" for the mailbox type, but may be
	refactored in the future.

	Add a stub mbox_close_mailbox function. This function does nothing,
	the main purpose is to introduce a mx_ops structure for mbox, so its
	usage is similar to mh/imap/pop. We reuse the name that was made
	available by the previous commmit. Note that the actual closing of
	the descriptor is done in mx.c.

	To be more consistent with other mailboxes, introduce functions
	mh_open_mailbox and maildir_open_mailbox, and create a dedicated
	structure for mmdf.

2016-05-12 12:41 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (6356f1068fe2)

	* mbox.c, mx.c, mx.h: rename mbox_close_mailbox to
	mx_close_mailbox_append and move it

	mbox_close_mailbox was used as the counterpart of
	mx_open_mailbox_append. To make things clearer, rename it
	mx_close_mailbox_append.

	As it is only used in mx.c, move it there and make it static.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, filter.c: Set COLUMNS to MuttIndexWindow->cols
	in mutt_create_filter_fd. (closes #3837)

	This allows filters to automatically (or via a command line
	argument) adjust to the width of the pager/index. This is even more
	important with the sidebar, since the width of the pager is smaller
	than the terminal width.

	Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for his helpful information and
	suggestions, and to Richard Russon for the initial patches.

	with Solaris and derivatives. After some discussion, the team
	decided it would be best to move away from using the "M_" prefix for
	macros.

	This patch was automatically generated by running: perl -wpi -e
	's/\bM_(\w+)\b/MUTT_$1/g' `find . -name '*.[ch]' -print` with the
	exception that sys_socket.h was exempted. (That file will be backed
	out subsequent to this commit.)

	Thanks to Andras Salamon for supplying the perl script used to make
	this change.

	* mbyte.c, pager.c: Skip bidi markers in the pager and index. (closes
	#3827)

	Curses and slang don't support them, so there's little point in
	showing them or attempting to somehow deal with them.

	This patch adds filtering in the pager, and changes the filtering
	added in 6e0aca94cdb0 for the index to completely skip the marker.

	* curs_lib.c: Change mutt_window_getyx() to accept NULL *y/*x params.

	Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for suggesting this nice cleanup.
	Previously, _mutt_get_field() was employing an ugly hack to avoid an
	unused var warning.

	* pager.c: Fix pager mini-index drawing when $pager_index_lines = 1
	and $status_on_top.

	When $pager_index_lines is 1, there is room for the index status
	line, but not for any actual index entries. The index redraw part
	was always calling menu_redraw_current() which doesn't actually
	check if there is room for the current row.

	This bug only shows up with $status_on_top, due to the order things
	are redrawn.

2016-04-30 10:50 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d0746905cb3f)

	* pager.c: Fix pager layout when $status_on_top with no mini-index.
	(closes #3836)

	The pager_window->row_offset should only be adjusted when we have a
	mini-index.

	Pull common window initialization above, and adjust only when the
	mini-index is enabled. The pager_window rows and row_offset code
	could be further consolidated (since the status line is always a
	height of one), but I think the code reads a bit more clearly when
	the adjustments are explicitly stated.

	* pager.c: Remove newline insertion from pager. (closes #3835)

	The window patches commited now manually move to the next line, so
	there is no need to insert newlines for that purpose.

	The newlines also goof windows placed to the right of the pager, as
	is the case for the (currently external) sidebar-on-the-right
	functionality.

	Thanks to Richard Russon for the original patch and help testing the
	revised patch.

	remailer.c, smime.c, status.c: Add cols parameter to
	mutt_FormatString()

	Continuing with the conversion to using windows for screen drawing,
	mutt_FormatString() was directly using COLS for right justification
	and similar formatting. Instead pass in a parameter, cols.

	This change involved seeding the parameter through callback
	functions too, as many of them call mutt_FormatString() back.

	* compose.c: Modify the compose screen to use windows.

	The header field positions enum is now started at 0: the windows
	compute the relative positioning as needed. A small improvement from
	this is that the headers now align with the top: there isn't a gap
	if $help is turned off.

	* copy.c, mutt_curses.h, pager.c, rfc3676.c: Modify the pager to use
	windows.

	The pager view is somewhat complex, due to the "mini-index" and the
	positioning of the index_status vs pager_status changes depending on
	$status_on_top as well as $pager_index_lines and $help.

	To make things simpler, it creates four "pager windows":
	index_status_window, index_window, pager_status_window,
	pager_window.

	mutt_term_width() is renamed to mutt_window_wrap_cols() and a
	mutt_window_t parameter passed in.

	Also, the pager drawing loop calling display_line() has a
	mutt_window_move() added to move to the beginning of the next line
	each time. This is in case the pager_window isn't flush with the
	left side of the terminal.

	* menu.c, mutt_curses.h, mutt_menu.h: Modify the menu code to use
	windows.

	Change menu.c to use the mutt_window_t structures and functions. The
	index/stats/help/message window pointers are stored inside the
	menu_t. This is useful for the pager, where the "index" we want to
	use is a mini-index.

2016-04-27 17:56 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ac4f746e614f)

	* curs_lib.c, init.c, init.h, main.c, mutt_curses.h, resize.c: Add
	window structures to use for screen layout.

	This is a series of 11 patches, centralizing Mutt screen drawing
	inside windows (mutt_window_t structures).

	Currently, the screen drawing and cursor positioning logic is
	distributed all over the code, resulting in many files having the
	same logic of where the help, status, message windows are.
	Additionally, the code directly uses move and mvadd*/mvprint*
	functions, which means if the layouts are changed, the row/column
	computation logic needs to be changed all over the place.

	The patch creates a (very simple) mutt_window_t structure and
	functions for moving, addch/str/printw, along with clearing the
	line. The windows keep track of where they are on the screen,
	allowing the Mutt code to simply position elements relative to the
	window.

	During curses initalization, and when the window is resized, the
	window sizes and positions and recomputed. Also, a new option flags,
	R_REFLOW is added for options that need to force a reflow when they
	are changed.

	Thanks to Richard Russon for pointing out the slang compilation
	issue.

	* muttlib.c: Fix right justify buffer-truncated pad calculation in
	mutt_FormatString()

	Vincent Lefèvre noted that the computation had implementation

	Change to make sure the subtraction won't lead to a wrap-around, and
	set pad to 0 in that case.

	* muttlib.c: Pre-space softfill multi-column padding.

	Similar to the previous patch, this deals with multi-column padding
	characters and soft-fill. This will add spacing so the padding and
	content after padding aligns with the right side.

	You can see the effect by setting set index_format="%s %*我[ooooo]"
	and resizing the terminal. The right hand side will be jagged
	without the patch.

2016-04-14 12:35 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (fef5b5ed0f44)

	* muttlib.c: Add spacing to truncated multi-column characters when
	using soft-fill.

	First, fix the left-hand side column truncation calculation: "col +
	pad*pw -offset" pad = (COLS - col - wid) / pw, so this becomes "col
	+ COLS - col - wid - offset" => "COLS - wid - offset"

	The problem is that pad was calculated *before* the right side was
	mutt_wstr_trunc() truncated, which may adjust wid! We want that
	calculation, with correct values, so instead just use the final
	reduction directly. (Note, the reduction ignores integer truncation,
	but pad shouldn't be used here in any case, because it's negative:
	there is no padding occuring).

	Second, when the left-hand side is truncated, multi-column
	characters may get chopped in the middle. Truncated characters are
	not included in the wlen and col values returned. Add spaces until
	the number of columns lines up (checking to make sure we don't run
	out of space too).

	retvals.

	While fixing up the error checking for mbrtowc(), I noticed the uses
	in pager.c format_line() were assigning the retval to an int.

	The cleanup for this was a little tricky, because it was making use
	of possible negative values for (k1 - k). The backspace detection
	loop condition was a bit heavy, so this patch first pulled the
	initialization and first call above, and put the second call inside
	the loop.

	Note that k1 previously included k, but this patch changes it to be
	just the retval of mbrtowc. This means the second mbrtowc()
	arguments are changed to include k, as is the ch increment at the
	bottom of the loop.

	Commit a07e8215a0ef introduced a bug in km_error_key, which is

	If help is bound to a sequence containing named keys (e.g. <esc>),
	the raw (untokenized) string would be pushed back into the unget
	buffer. This could lead to an infinite loop of unbound key presses
	triggering more unbound keys being put into the unget buffer.

	Change km_error_key to tokenize the string before putting it in the
	unget buffer.

	Much thanks to Jiri Bohac for his bug report, analysis, and initial
	patch!

	sys_socket.h: Create a wrapper sys_socket.h to work around Solaris
	namespace issues. (closes #3833)

	Solaris includes "sys/stream.h" inside their "sys/socket.h". This
	include file adds many non-reserved macros to Mutt's namespace, two
	of which conflict with existing Mutt macros.

	The simplest fix would be to rename those macros in Mutt, however
	this will cause difficulty with out-of-tree patches. This fix
	creates a wrapper include file that preserves those existing macros
	and prevents the Solaris values from entering Mutt's namespace.

	* crypt.c, send.c: Fix mutt_protect() when INLINE is set. (closes
	#3828)

	The oppenc changes allow security bits to be set even when not
	encrypting or signing (for instance, OPPENCRYPT and INLINE).

	mutt_protect() assumed that if INLINE is set, then either ENCRYPT or
	SIGN must also be set. Specifically, it would end up inline-signing
	the message even though neither was set.

	Ensure mutt_protect() is a noop if neither SIGN or ENCRYPT are set.

	In ci_send_message(), check for sign or encrypt before calling the
	crypt_get_keys() / mutt_protect() block, and also in the fcc section
	(since clear_content would be NULL if not).

	The second change to the fcc part is somewhat redundant, but better
	to be explicit and avoid the case where the subtype is somehow
	"encrypted" or "signed" even though msg->security wasn't set thus.

	functions in mutt_idna.h.

	* Makefile.am: Fix hcversion.h generation error when using included
	gettext.

	When configuring mutt with --enable-hcache and
	--with-included-gettext, there is an automake ordering issue:
	BUILT_SOURCES are processed before SUBDIRS. Therefore, the
	'hcversion.h' target is run before the included gettext (intl) is
	built.

	The hcversion.h target runs the cpp over config.h and mutt.h, but
	mutt.h includes lib.h which tries to #include <libintl.h>.
	Unfortunately, libintl.h (in this configuration) is generated by the
	intl subdir build and so doesn't exist yet.

	While the build doesn't completely fail, the resulting hcversion.h
	is incorrect: it's just the md5sum of the initial value of
	BASEVERSION.

	This fix is somewhat of a hack but is cleaner than trying to change
	automake's behavior. It inserts a '#undef ENABLE_NLS' in between the
	config.h and mutt.h sent to the cpp. Since hcachever.sh is just
	scanning the data structures used by mutt, this shouldn't affect the
	hash generated.

	Thanks to Will Yardley for reporting this issue.

	Filter out U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK and U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK
	in rfc2047 and 2231 encoded fields. GNU Screen has a bug that
	corrupts the display, and can cause the wrong email to appear to be
	selected in the index. Until screen fixes the issue, filter it out
	in mutt.

	* imap/imap.c: Fix error handling in sync_helper() and
	imap_sync_mailbox(). (closes #3817)

	This patch is based on the one Richard Russon found in the Fedora
	package.

	If an error occurs during one of the imap_exec() calls in
	imap_sync_mailbox(), the mailbox could end up being closed. This
	would cause idata->ctx to be NULL. Add a check in sync_helper() for
	the case where idata->ctx == NULL.

	In imap_sync_mailbox(), check the return value of sync_helper(). To
	keep the code simple, change rc from being the sum of the calls to
	the bitwise-OR of the calls. (We only need to know if a single flag
	needs to be updated, and bitwise-OR will detect negatives.)

	Below the calls to sync_helper(), if the call to imap_exec() fails,
	make sure rc is set to -1.

	The root folder results in mx.mbox being NULL, which causes a
	segfault. This can be triggered by entering a subfolder and trying
	to rename the ".." entry.

	Due to the translation string freeze, no visible error message is
	displayed. Add a TODO note about this for post-1.6 release.

	* imap/browse.c: Fix uninitialized prompt buffer in
	imap_mailbox_rename(). (closes #3819)

	This is a patch from OpenBSD to initialize the newname buffer in
	imap_mailbox_rename(). Previously it would generate random garbage
	in the prompt.

	This version of the patch initializes the prompt to the old mailbox
	name.

	Thanks to TAKAHASHI Tamotsu for finding this patch.

	* curs_lib.c, protos.h: Clean up mutt_wstr_trunc() some more.

	* Change return type to size_t. The return value is the cumulation
	of values from mbrtowc(), which returns size_t. All callers already
	assign the return value to a size_t, requiring no external changes.

	* Change the local variables n, w, l, and cl to size_t. n is the
	strlen of the src parameter. l and cl are used for the return value.
	w is assigned to the *width parameter, which is size_t.

	 cw is kept as an int, because wcwidth returns type int.

	* Change error handling of mbrtowc to be the same as other functions
	in mutt: only reset mbstate when the retval==-1. When retvat==-2,
	set cl=n to break out of the loop. Also, set wc to replacement_char
	and allow the logic below to determine the width instead of
	hardcoding to 1.

	* curs_lib.c: Improve error handling in mutt_wstr_trunc().

	This is Karel Zak's patch to fix handling of (illegal) multi-byte
	chars.

	 * mutt_wstr_trunc(): Reset mbstate after error in mbrtowc(). Set
	wc=0 if wcwidth returns < 0.

	The Doctor reported triggering an assertion in convert_file_to(),
	due to an unexpected errno from iconv(). According to the comments,

	turned off. We certainly don't want to abort mutt for this case, so

	* hcache.c: Fix tcbdb error reporting to use ecode, not errno.

	After committing aff8d62ebddb and taking a closer look at the tcbdb
	documentation, I realized those functions don't set errno.

	Change the error handling messages to instead get the ecode and
	message using tcbdbecode() and tcbdberrmsg().

2016-03-16 13:33 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (aff8d62ebddb)

	* hcache.c: Fix crash in hcache_open_tc() when open fails and debug is
	on. (closes #3813)

	When the hcache open fails, it was trying to dprint. The dprint had
	a %s where it was passing errno, leading to a crash in strlen.

	Unify the dprint messages for tcdbopen and tcdbclose to report the
	path, strerror, and errno.

	Thanks to Will Yardley for capturing the stack trace!

	The previous patch from Vincent exposed a crash if ftruncate() fails
	in mbox_sync_mailbox(). Change fclose() to safe_fclose(), to avoid
	it being called twice.

	Additionally, the order logic wasn't correct.

	* init.h, main.c, mutt.h: Add $resume_edited_draft_files option.

	This adds an extra header when saving edited draft files (-E -H on
	the command line). With this header, the next time they are edited,
	they are automatically "resumed" (by setting $resume_draft_files).

	The idea is to prevent multiple user-defined headers and signatures
	from being added to the draft message by avoiding processing it as a
	brand new message after the first time.

2016-03-08 15:57 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (24b4f14e9538)

	* init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Add $resume_draft_files option.

	When set, draft files are processed the same as when resuming
	postponed messages. One use of this option is to avoid multiple
	user-defined headers and signatures being added to the message.
	(e.g. when -E is used repeatedly on the draft files).

	Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for the memory leak fix.

2016-03-02 15:08 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (8e77637a1a69)

	messages.

2016-03-02 15:08 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (6034900d1636)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Add hard redraw for the gpgme application/pgp
	handler.

	Will Yardley reported display artifacts and keyboard issues after
	decrypting a traditional pgp message using gpgme. It turns out the
	gpgpme code path was missing a hard_redraw() to repaint the screen
	after pinentry.

2016-02-28 19:42 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d11b6776532f)

	* main.c, mutt.h, send.c: Draft file tweeks: rename flag, don't auto-
	abort on no change.

	Rename the flag to SENDDRAFTFILE since it will be used in contexts
	other than the body allocation.

	Don't automatically abort if the message was unchanged; it seems
	possible the draft files could be used as the entire message reply.

2016-02-15 19:44 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (909cf6dd067c)

	* contrib/gpg.rc, crypt-gpgme.c, globals.h, init.h, pgp.c: Add
	$pgp_decryption_okay to verify multipart/encrypted are actually
	encrypted. (closes #3770)

	In pgp classic mode, if the $pgp_decrypt_command generated output,
	it assumed the content was encrypted. However, gpg will generate
	output even if the block is simply signed and armored text. The
	problem is that mutt was then printing mime headers labelling the
	output as encrypted text in the ui.

	Add a new option, and suggested value of: set
	pgp_decryption_okay="^\\[GNUPG:\\] DECRYPTION_OKAY" If set, the
	output from the decrypt command will be scanned for this regexp to
	confirm an actual decryption occurred.

	Note that gpgme already correctly rejects this form of spoofed
	message.

2016-02-11 15:12 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b55c6a64a07b)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Update the status message after decryption using
	gpgpme.

	Change gpgme to behave the same as classic pgp mode: after a
	decryption, update the status message to overwrite the initial
	"Invoking PGP..." message.

2016-02-07 10:15 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (87c46e1f6f8c)

	* postpone.c: Fix pgp and smime decryption in mutt_prepare_template().

	Change the "combined" multipart decryption block to only work for
	pgp, since mutt_is_multipart_encrypted() currently only checks for
	pgp headers and it therefore only worked for pgp in the first place.

	Fix the newhdr->security to be based on what that function returns,
	instead of the "context" hdr passed in.

	Add a smime decryption block below when iterating through the
	content.

	Fix the application/pgp decryption block to assign to hdr->security
	using the type of the app/pgp part instead of hdr->content.

2016-02-07 10:15 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a4d885bb36ab)

	* compose.c, doc/manual.xml.head, doc/mutt.man, main.c, mutt.h,
	protos.h, send.c: Add new flag -E to modify draft/include file.
	(closes #3799)

	Specifying -E with -i will cause mutt to directly edit the include
	file.

	Specifying -E with -H will cause the draft file to be regenerated
	from the latest version of the email on exit.

	Improve -H so that it will read (and write) multipart messages.

2016-01-23 12:30 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (df42596d08fe)

	* lib.h: Increase HUGE_STRING size to 8192. (see #3804)

	The interface for editing a large number of recipients is poor and
	perhaps shouldn't be using a fixed buffer size. Until a redesign can
	be thought about, this will help.

2016-01-19 14:05 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b315c4d4ede7)

	* imap/auth_sasl.c, pop_auth.c, smtp.c: Make sasl authentication
	buffers dynamically sized. (see #3804)

	The reporter found that the current buffer of HUGE_STRING was
	insufficient in his case to encode the clientout response back to
	the server in imap_auth_sasl().

	Since sasl gives us the size of "clientout", we can dynamically
	malloc and resize the buffer as needed. This patch uses
	max(LONG_STRING, (clientoutlen*2)). This is sufficient to hold the
	base64 encoded value plus additional prefix/suffix needed in each
	protocol.

	The size is rechecked after each sasl_client_step() and resized as
	needed.

	Similar code is in pop_auth_sasl() and smtp_auth_sasl(), so convert
	all three to use a dynamic buffer.

2016-01-05 18:08 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7c0bd34546f4)

	* smime.c: Allow tab as a delimiter in smime .index files. (closes
	#3802)

	The old parsing code used fscanf, and so happened to allow a tab as
	a delimiter. Even though smime_keys.pl uses a space, some users
	maintain their own .index files by hand (using tab delimiters), so
	continue to allow that delimiter.

	Thanks to Andre for the bug report and patch.

2016-01-04 16:28 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cf4c1c21e58d)

	* compose.c: Add a couple missing ATTACHPTR->tree frees.

	While working on ticket 3800, I noticed the tree wasn't being freed
	inside OP_COMPOSE_EDIT_HEADERS. Add a free there, and in the cleanup
	at the end of mutt_compose_menu().

	A few other sections in mutt_compose_menu() are performing a free-
	on-error where the tree isn't allocated yet, so skip it for those.

	I believe this is actually not fixing a memory leak: all attachments
	are always at level 0 in the compose menu (as far as I know); so
	nothing is ever allocated in the tree pointer. However since other
	parts of the code in compose.c clean this up, it make sense to add
	them here too.

2016-01-04 13:57 -0800  S. Gilles  <sgilles@math.umd.edu>  (960017a249f7)

	* color.c: Prefer bright versions (8-15) of colors for brightXXX
	backgrounds.

	When a bright color is specified as a background, try to use the
	bright version of that color, falling back to the A_BLINK method
	only on terms which do not support enough colors.

2016-01-01 12:24 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d3f31cf9239e)

	* parse.c: Use strrchr to search for Received date separator. (closes
	#3798)

	Sample email provided by the submitter showed a Received header with
	a ";" at the end of each line, instead of a single ";" in front of
	the date. The emails are obviously not RFC compliant, but the fix is
	simple enough: find the last ";" using strrchr instead of the first.

	When attachments are deleted, delete_attachment() slides the entries
	down in the idx array, but forgets to NULL out the last vacated
	slot.

	If more attachments are added later on via OP_COMPOSE_EDIT_HEADERS
	and the Attach: pseudo-header, mutt_gen_attach_list() will attempt
	to re-use the ATTACHPTR in that last slot because it wasn't set to
	NULL. This will be pointing to freed memory and likely segfault (at
	best).

	* mh.c: Fix hash table key "use after free" in mh_check_mailbox().
	(closes #3797)

	The fnames hash uses the maildir->header->path as the key. As
	matches are found, the headers are freed. This inadvertantly also
	freed the key to the hashtable entry; the next hash_find() going to
	the same bucket might end up comparing keys with a freed string.

	This patch stores the path in the struct maildir canon_fname field
	(just as maildir_check_mailbox() does) and uses that as the hash key
	instead. This field isn't used outside of maildir_check_mailbox(),
	and is automatically freed for us in the maildir_move_to_context()
	call at the bottom of both functions.

	Note there are other ways to fix this problem:
	- Add a new mode to the hash table, causing it to strdup the keys and
	free them itself.
	- Delete the entries in the fnames hash, rather leaving them there.
	The first seems the cleanest, but would end up touching much more
	code. The second is also clean, but might have a negative
	performance impact.

	Additionally, peeking back in history to changeset 1d45a50b6f9b, it
	looks like the canon_fname used to be used by mh too, so perhaps
	removing the strdup may have been a mistake during refactoring at
	some point.

	"pkcs7-signature" in one and "x-pkcs7-signature" in the other.

	* contrib/smime.rc, globals.h, init.h, smime.c: smime: allow signing
	message digest algorithm to be specified.

	Currently, Mutt hardcodes micalg=sha1 for signed messages.
	Unfortunately, the actual message digest algorithm used defaults to
	the value in the "Signature Algorithm" field in the signing key's
	certificate.

	Add a new configuration option $smime_sign_digest_alg, defaulting to
	sha256. Add a new printf format string, %d, to be used in the
	signing command to specify the digest algorithm. Modify the sample
	$smime_sign_command to include "-md %d".

	Note: This solution requires using the modified $smime_sign_command,
	or else the micalg parameter again may not match the algorithm used.
	An alternative solution would be to query the certificate "Signature
	Algorithm" field and try to change the micalg to match it, but this
	method is easier to implement and provides better control for the
	user to configure, in any case.

	* curs_lib.c, lib.h, pattern.c, rfc2047.c, rfc822.c: Fix possible
	unintentional '\0' strchr matches.

	After fixing the ticket 3787 strchr issue, this patch cleans up
	other potentially incorrect uses of strchr for the '\0' case.

	In mutt_multi_choice(), mutt_getch() can technically return 0.
	Although it seems the user would have to try quite hard to do this,
	it's incorrect to return that index into letters. Change "ch.ch==0"
	to be considered the same as an abort.

	is_email_wsp() is used in a couple places where it wasn't obvious
	whether '\0' was being accounted for, so add an explicit check to
	the function.

	Inside eat_date(), if mutt_extract_token() had no input and returned
	"", the strchr ("<>=", buffer.data[0]) below would return a pointer.
	In actuality, this is prevented by an empty parameter check inside
	mutt_pattern_comp(), but it doesn't hurt to make it the same as
	eat_regexp() and have the check explicitly done here too.

	rfc2047_encode() was another borderline case for adding a check. The
	convert_string() sets a length, so it seems highly unlikely that *t
	could be 0, but doesn't hurt to add the check.

	The find_encoded_word() fix looks necessary. If the passed in s was
	something like "=?charset?" (followed by EOS, '\0'), the
	strchr("BbQq", q[1]) would in fact return a pointer and the
	following q[2] would read past the end of string. If q[2] happened
	to be '?', it might even continue reading in the for loop below.

	Lastly, in parse_mailboxdomain(), the potential overread was already
	fixed in changeset:a6919571eb59, but although the nonspecial and
	special strchr() line happens to "work" for the case of '\0', it's
	pretty fragile to leave as is. It's better to be explicit and just
	return if we hit EOS without calling next_token().

	* rfc822.c: Fix next_token() oob read. (closes #3787)

	With specially crafted input to 'mutt -H', the line "Return-Path:<()
	" is read and passed to mutt_parse_rfc822_line(). "<() " is then
	passed through to rfc822_parse_adrlist().

	Eventually, inside next_token(), is_special(*s) is called when s
	points to the end of the string ('\0'). This macro calls strchr,
	which will actually match and return a pointer to the trailing '\0'
	in RFC822Specials! This causes "s + 1" to be returned, skipping past
	the end of string inside parse_mailboxdomain().

	This patch adds a check to make sure *s is non-null before calling

	separate macro/push/exec event buffer. (closes #3779)

	Currently, the SSL and TLS certficate prompts turn on
	OPTUNBUFFEREDINPUT, (to prevent macros and such from running right
	through the dialog). Unfortunately, the menu dialog processing in
	menu_dialog_dokey() is using mutt_ungetch() to forward non-dialog
	keys on to standard menu processing. With OPTUNBUFFEREDINPUT set,
	those keys never make it to the menu and are buffered until after
	the menu dialog.

	This patch creates a new event buffer, separate from the standard
	"unget" buffer, for use by macros, exec, and push events. These
	events can be temporarily ignored by setting OPTIGNOREMACROEVENTS
	(renamed from OPTUNBUFFEREDINPUT), while continuing to allow unget
	events to be processed.

	Since the "push" and "unget" functions now go to different buffers,
	function names were slightly renamed, to make it less easy to
	unintentionally use the wrong function at the wrong time.

	* imap/browse.c: Fix double-decode during IMAP browse.

	cmd_parse_list() already calls imap_unmunge_mbox_name() on the

	browse_add_list_result() was taking those mailbox names and passing
	them to imap_add_folder(), which was calling
	imap_unmunge_mbox_name() yet again.

	The reason is that imap_browse() was directly calling
	imap_add_folder() too, passing in a previously encoded "mbox" name.
	After looking carefully at the code, I could find no reason that
	mbox needed to be encoded outside of the LIST commands.. Therefore I
	changed imap_browse() to call imap_munge_mbox_name() on mbox for the
	two LIST commands generated from it instead, and removed the
	imap_unmunge_mbox_name() call inside imap_add_folder().

2015-08-30 10:26 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a494c8f932fa)

	* .hgtags: Added tag mutt-1-5-24-rel for changeset 08e81162482f

2015-08-30 10:21 -0700  Benno Schulenberg  <i18n@benno.vertaalt.nl>  (d9b1c4b6662f)

	* po/eo.po: Partially updated Esperanto translation.

2015-08-30 10:18 -0700  Benno Schulenberg  <i18n@benno.vertaalt.nl>  (b9864644b6a2)

	* commands.c: Minor translation fixes.

	This makes two equivalent translation messages the exact same so
	they only need to be translated once.

	It also adds a missing translation marker (for the same string).

	This same string is used in recvcmd.c so does not generate a new
	translation string.

2015-08-30 10:08 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (934fbd272ce6)

	* UPDATING: Set release date. Minor fixes to release notes.

2015-08-29 12:51 -0700  Ivan Vilata i Balaguer  <ivan@selidor.net>  (faa85ed8a7c9)

	* po/ca.po: Updated Catalan translation.

2015-08-29 12:40 -0700  Benno Schulenberg  <i18n@benno.vertaalt.nl>  (14a2ad40e954)

	* po/nl.po: Updated Dutch translation.

2015-08-29 07:40 -0700  Benno Schulenberg  <i18n@benno.vertaalt.nl>  (0d346dc8dccb)

	* smime.c: Minor translation fix.

	This makes two equivalent translation messages the exact same so
	they only need to be translated once.

2015-08-28 07:35 -0700  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (e33ba8f72a40)

	* po/ja.po: Updated Japanese translation.

2015-08-20 11:18 -0700  Vsevolod Volkov  <vvv@mutt.org.ua>  (b3c095648df6)

	* po/ru.po: Updated Russian translation.

2015-08-19 09:41 -0700  Petr Pisar  <petr.pisar@atlas.cz>  (83760f05bb46)

	* po/cs.po: Updated Czech translation

2015-08-17 14:51 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c0180991c352)

	* configure.ac: Add idn to MUTTLIBS instead of LIBS (see #3638)

	Currently, -lidn is included while linking all the mutt binaries.
	Add it to MUTTLIBS instead so it's only used for the mutt linking.

	Also, add $LIBICONV to $LIBS before checking for some of the idna
	functions. On some sytems, there are apparently issues when using
	static linking. (Thanks to grarpamp for reporting).

2015-08-17 12:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (356443232291)

	* muttlib.c, protos.h: Change mutt_adv_mktemp to call mutt_mktemp
	instead of mktemp. (see #3638).

	mutt_mktemp is currently called in 95% of the cases in mutt, and is
	already our "own rolled" version of mktemp. The "insecure mktemp
	warning" discussion keeps coming up, so instead add prefix and
	suffix functionality to mutt_mktemp() and call that.

	All other uses of Tempdir in the mutt source did not call
	mutt_expand_path() first, so remove that from mutt_adv_mktemp().

2015-08-17 12:26 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (8b2fe6a4db79)

	* configure.ac: Enable C99 mode for compiler. (See #3638).

	This is already the default for clang (FreeBSD) so shouldn't cause
	any issues.

	Enabling this will increase the allowed static string length and
	remove the Copyright length warning.

2015-08-11 11:20 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (55ea6e829b46)

	* Makefile.am: Compile txt2c using automake rules.

	The compilation rule used $< which isn't portable for ordinary make
	rules.

2015-08-11 11:20 -0700  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (eb4aaf4581ac)

	* txt2c.sh: Fix txt2c.sh sed invocations to use posix syntax.

2015-08-07 03:38 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (711708700602)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2015-07-29 09:26 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (34ca1c5fdd45)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Minor documentation fix.

	In one place, the documentation mentioned 'alternative-order'
	instead of 'alternative_order'.

2015-07-29 09:07 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (75e398daa94c)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, hook.c: Add error handling for ^ and other
	empty mailbox shortcuts.

	(closes #2402) (closes #3735)

	Explicitly mention the ^ example in the documentation added in
	6d733cab6b45.

	Add an error message for ^ when CurrentFolder is not set. Add checks
	for other mailbox shortcuts that expand to the empty string. This
	could happen if the @alias shortcut was accidentally used, or the
	value referenced by a shortcut isn't set yet.

2015-07-27 14:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (6d733cab6b45)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Add "Mailbox Matching in Hooks" section to
	manual.

	Folder-hook and mbox-hook perform mailbox shortcut expansion on the
	regexp parameter. Add a section to the manual to give examples and
	make the behavior clearer.

2015-07-26 14:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (21a08f9abc80)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, crypt.c, handler.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c,
	recvattach.c: Handle malformed ms-exchange pgp-encrypted block.
	(closes #3742)

	In certain circumstances, Exchange corrupts a multipart/encrypted
	block into: <multipart/mixed> <text/plain> <application /pgp-
	encrypted> [BASE64-encoded] <application/octet-stream>
	[BASE64-encoded]

	This patch pulls the full detection of valid/invalid multiparts into
	mutt_body_handler(). It extracts a run_decode_and_handler()
	function, which is reused by new intermediate handlers to decode the
	application/octet-stream part before passing it directly to
	crypt_pgp_encrypted_handler. These intermediate handlers then check
	and set any GOODSIG flags back into the parent part.

	This change may result in less error messages for invalid
	multipart/encrypted parts. Instead, mutt will default to the
	multipart_handler if it isn't fully "correct".

	Viewing attachments uses crypt_pgp_decrypt_mime() which bypasses the
	handler mechanism. Add decoding to the decrypt_mime() functions for
	pgp and gpgme.

	Thanks to Vincent Brillault for his analysis and initial patch.

2015-07-18 18:40 +0200  Martin Sandsmark  <martin@sandsmark.ninja>  (e40e3e0391ea)

	* UPDATING, buffy.c, init.h, mutt.h: Add support for checking cur/ in
	Maildir for unread mails in buffy.

	Also skip messages with the S flag when checking for unread mails.

2015-07-24 13:36 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (fdafc56a854f)

	* doc/Makefile.am: Set AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS in doc/Makefile.am. (closes
	#3766)

	Add the "foreign" option to silence warnings generated by
	flymake.am.

2015-07-24 13:15 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cbae8642cb3d)

	* UPDATING: Update the UPDATING file with changes since 1.5.23.

2015-07-23 14:57 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (8c16206f50a1)

	* hcache.c, help.c, imap/util.c, protos.h, sendlib.c: Fix compiler
	type warnings. (closes #3765)

	The output of mutt_local_tz() was being passed to abs(). Technically
	the return type is time_t, but it represents a small value: the
	timezone offset in seconds. Add a safe explicit cast to int.

	Change the txt parameter of mutt_make_help() to type const char *.
	Typically all calls run the txt parameter through _(), which accepts
	const char * and returns a char *. However, if NLS is not enabled,
	_() is a noop, simply returning the parameter itself. In
	mutt_compile_help(), items[i].name is const char *, so it will
	generate a warning when passed as the txt parameter of
	mutt_make_help().

	On some systems, e.g. OS X, snprintf is defined as a macro. One call
	in hcache.c was embedding directives inside the snprintf call. This
	is apparently undefined behavior, so duplicate the call instead.

2015-07-22 19:23 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c60fed102d79)

	* imap/message.c, keymap.c, pop_lib.c: Fix a few small compiler
	warnings. (See #3638)

	In certain configurations, unused variables and labels were causing
	warnings.

	Add a missing "#include <netinet/in.h>" to pop_lib.c.

2015-07-21 12:41 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (704e0622cc67)

	* imap/imap.c: merge stable

2015-07-21 12:34 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e5fe2f80e797)

	* imap/imap.c: Imap: Fix flag caching after sync.

	The flags cached in IMAP_HEADER_DATA were not updated to match the
	HEADER flags after a sync. This means if a flag were toggled and
	synced twice, the second sync was not sending the flag update.

	Thanks to Noah Misch for the patch.

2015-07-19 15:55 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (100835c4a8ac)

	* init.h: Add note about gpg fixed-list-mode. (closes #3763).

	Thanks to Gregor Zattler for the original patch.

2015-07-11 14:36 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (2ca89bed6448)

	* main.c: Fix batch mode lockup. (closes #3761) (closes #3760)

	The new TS capability check was also running when curses wasn't
	initialized. Move check inside the !OPTNOCURSES block.

2015-07-09 14:50 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7e91a8855dc3)

	* Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am, imap/Makefile.am: Use $(VAR) instead
	of @VAR@ in Makefile.am files. (closes #3664)

	The @VAR@ form is not overridable, such as the case for #3664 where
	the reporter wanted to override DOTLOCK_GROUP.

	It's doubtful targets need to be overriden, but it makes sense to be
	consistent in the usage of automake substituted variables unless
	there is a particular reason/bug to work around.

2015-07-05 13:38 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (79cd2f34961d)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Remove 'hit enter' prompt for GPGME initialization
	errors.

	Older GPGMEs are missing CMS (S/MIME) support. Don't force the poor
	users to hit enter every time they start mutt.

2015-07-02 11:21 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (39422ec14f60)

	* .hgignore, mkinstalldirs: Remove the automake mkinstalldirs script.

	Add to .hgignore so it doesn't accidentally get added again.

2015-07-02 11:21 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (97ef326274e7)

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, contrib/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am,
	intl/Makefile.in, m4/gettext.m4, po/Makefile.in.in: Convert from
	using mkinstalldirs to $(MKDIR_P).

	The automake mkinstalldirs script is now deprecated. "install-sh -d"
	can be used in place. Configure.ac already includes AC_PROG_INSTALL,
	which will ensure install-sh is bundled. Add AC_PROG_MKDIR_P, which
	will set $(MKDIR_P) to either a thread-safe "mkdir -p" or will fall
	back to using install-sh.

2015-07-02 11:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (67d945e38074)

	* build-release: Fix build-release to always update automake tools.
	(closes #3671)

	1.5.22 and 1.5.23 include a version of "missing" older than the
	version of automake/aclocal used to generate configure.

	Fix the build-release script to always copy and force update of the
	automake tools.

2015-06-29 14:35 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (9802a6172edf)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Add note to manual clarifying push/exec and
	folder-hook order.

	Folder-hooks are executed in the order declared. However, push/exec
	commands will simply prepend to the keyboard buffer. If there are
	multiple push/exec commands, each will prepend to the earlier one.
	The result is that they will end up being "run" in reverse order
	once keyboard buffer processing starts.

2015-06-26 12:23 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (3bbb1f569eb1)

	* imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/imap.c: Fix IMAP segfault due to NULL capstr.

	After a failed login, the connection is left open but capstr is
	freed. If a second login attempt is made, imap_auth_sasl was trying
	to strstr using the NULL capstr.

	Add a NONULL around the capstr parameter to strstr. Change
	imap_conn_find() to keep the capstr around until a successful
	authentication occurs.

2015-06-26 11:38 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b4be5796a458)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, pgp.c, smime.c: Add comment about "(f)orget it"
	choice in pgp/smime send menus.

2015-06-26 12:28 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (b640b23e64a8)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2015-06-07 13:59 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (17a4f92e4a95)

	* smime.c, smime.h: Rewrite S/MIME key searching. Add purpose
	checking.

	Model the smime.c searching off of classic pgp searching. Create
	smime_get_key_by_hash()/addr()/str() functions that use a single
	smime_get_candidates() function to search the index.

	Use the new smime_keys generated purpose flag in the index to filter
	by KEYFLAG_CANENCRYPT and KEYFLAG_CANSIGN. Old style indices fall
	back to all-inclusive behavior.

2015-06-07 13:59 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (106914bc9406)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: Add refresh command.

	Refresh verifies the trust of each certificate and adds the purpose
	flag if it is missing. It pushes those values to the private keys'
	index file too.

2015-06-07 13:59 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (aabd030b25cb)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: Add purpose flag to index.

	A subsequent patch will change smime.c to use the purpose to filter
	certs and keys that can't be used for signing or encryption.

	Issuer, trust, and purpose flags were also added to the keys index
	file, to keep parsing simpler in smime_keys as well as smime.c. The
	trust and purpose are derived from the cert. Issuer is set to '?' as
	this should never be needed for keys.

2015-05-25 10:59 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (0255b37be491)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: Handle certificate chains in add_cert.
	(closes #3339) (closes #3559)

	Find all chains in the certificate provided. For each chain create a
	separate leaf and intermediate certificate file. Because Mutt
	controls the label prompt, use a single label for all chains.

	Also, loosen up cert file parsing to allow attributes even if they
	aren't delimited by a "Bag Attributes" header.

	Thanks to David J. Weller-Fahy for his testing and feedback!

2015-05-18 13:27 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (577987ca2d02)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: Convert openssl execution to use
	open("-|",...). (see #3575) (see #2456)

	This does a fork/exec, bypassing the shell, and so handles spaces,
	quotes, and other shell-characters problems better than the simple
	fix in changeset:c66a6bd5d0d5

	This also fixes the "verify with crl" bug in #2456: the grep is now
	done in perl.

	Thank you Vincent Lefevre for your review and feedback!

2015-05-18 03:25 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (82d43abf2a37)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation (related to PGP & S/MIME, with
	corrections).

2015-05-15 14:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c66a6bd5d0d5)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: quote filenames. (closes #3575) (see
	#2456)

	Wrap the various filename parameters in single quotes in case there
	are spaces in the filename.

2015-05-15 10:47 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (babc30377614)

	* smime_keys.pl: Start cleaning up and fixing smime_keys.pl (closes
	#3324) (see #2456)

	* Convert to using File::Temp (#3324). This was also suggested at
	https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=775199

	* Use File::Temp for add_p12 temp file. (#2456)

	* Make the query_label() method a bit more robust with empty
	strings, ctrl-d, and leading spaces.

	* Clean up openssl_do_verify() logic. Mark cert as invalid rather
	that die'ing if an openssl verify command fails.

	* General cleanup:
	  - Clearly separate op handler, certificate management, and helper
	functions by section and using prefixes.
	  - Create openssl helper functions to reduce copy/paste invocations and
	make the code clearer.
	  - Make indentation consistent at 2 spaces.
	  - Change handle_add_pem() to re-use handle_add_chain() once the
	correct files are identified.
	  - Change openssl_parse_pem() to return a single array of data
	structures representing the parsed certs/keys.

2015-05-03 16:25 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c46dfbdb5eff)

	* globals.h, init.h, mutt_ssl.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Provide SSL cipher
	selection option. (closes #3167)

	Creates a $ssl_ciphers option that allows direct selection of the
	ciphers for OpenSSL (via SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list) and GnuTLS (via
	gnutls_priority_set_direct).

	Thank you Sergio Gelato for the patch.

2015-04-25 19:00 -0700  Seth Forshee  <seth@forshee.me>  (755a18da99bc)

	* handler.c: Fix performance regression for ~b/~B searching. (closes
	#3743)

	In mutt_is_autoview(), changeset b58cdfacfb89 introduced a call to
	rfc1524_mailcap_lookup() before checking if the MIME type should be
	autoviewed based on the user's preferences. This caused a major
	performance regression for ~b/~B searching.

	Rearrange mutt_is_autoview() to check the user preferences first,
	then search for a mailcap entry only if the MIME type should be
	autoviewed.

	In order to preserve correct mime_lookup behavior, re-add a call to
	mutt_check_lookup_list() before scanning the AutoViewList.

2015-04-19 13:15 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (067a3ac42c3b)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, doc/manual.xml.head, init.h, mutt.h, pgp.c: Add
	$crypt_confirmhook option. (see #3727)

	Allow the confirmation prompt for crypt-hooks to be disabled. This
	is useful for multiple crypt-hook users (e.g. encrypted mailing
	lists), or just for people who are certain of their crypt-hooks and
	don't want to be prompted every time.

	Thanks to Dale Woolridge for the original patch.

2015-04-19 13:15 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b4c57d3fd7e8)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head, hook.c,
	pgp.c, protos.h: Allow multiple crypt-hooks with the same regexp.
	(closes #3727).

	Changes the crypt-hook to accumulate a LIST of hooks with the same
	regexp, as opposed to replacing the hook data. This is useful for
	the case of encrypted mailing lists.

	Update pgp classic and gpgme to process a LIST of crypt-hook values
	instead of just one.

	This version of the patch creates a new _mutt_list_hook() function
	that (in theory) other hooks could use if they were changed to
	return a list. It also changes the behavior when a crypt-hook is
	declined: previously it would immediately use the original recipient
	for key selection. Now it will only do that if all crypt-hooks for a
	recipient are declined. This allows all, a subset, or none of the
	hooks to be used.

	Thanks to Rejo Zenger, Remco Rijnders, and Dale Woolridge for their
	work on various versions of this patch.

2015-04-15 19:25 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1e26a962ab7a)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Fix a few more incorrect documentation lines
	for hooks.

	Hopefully this finishes up aac979f8b529 and ca5aff2a4b6e.

2015-04-15 18:57 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d12cb775b779)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, doc/manual.xml.head, init.h, pgp.c, pgp.h, pgpkey.c:
	Use fingerprints instead of keyIDs internally. (see #3695)

	Add a helper function, pgp_fpr_or_lkeyid(), that returns the
	fingerprint if available, otherwise falls back to the long key id.
	Convert Mutt to use that value for pgp command invocation.

	Change gpgme to use an equivalent crypt_fpr_or_lkeyid() function in
	a couple places too (for keylist generation and sign-as key
	selection).

	Update documentation to mention fingerprints and the --with-
	fingerprint option for gpg invocation.

	Change pgp_long_ids to default: yes, but add a note mentioning it's
	only used for the display of key IDs in a few places.

2015-03-12 14:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (bd21cff208c4)

	* recvattach.c: Allow attachments from unencrypted emails to be
	deleted.

	* doc/muttrc.man.head: Clarify hook pattern vs regexp in muttrc.man
	page.

	Updates to the muttrc.man page were inadvertently not included in
	changeset:aac979f8b529. Fix mbox-hook and crypt-hook to show they
	accept a regexp, not a pattern.

	Thanks to David J. Weller-Fahy for that patch.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1bd26d871d76)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix const errors caused by find_keys() changes.

	Part 4 of the oppenc series changed the keyID type to const as part
	of some cleanup changes. At the time, that only propagated to
	crypt_getkeybystr(), but with the fingerprint changes, this is
	starting to propagate too far.

	Create a separate non-const variable to deal with the crypt hook
	value and revert crypt_getkeybystr()'s parameter to non-const.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b8ead28d8e84)

	* compose.c, crypt-gpgme.c, pgp.c, smime.c: Add ui elements for oppenc
	mode.

	Add a status message to the Security line when oppenc is enabled.

	For each send menu, add the ability to toggle it on or off. When
	enabled, the menus won't show the (e)ncrypt or (b)oth options, and
	the (c)lear function only clears the SIGN bit when it is active.

	Change the gpgme_send_menu() to directly use the ENCRYPT and SIGN
	flags instead of the PGPENCRYPT/SIGN and SMIMEENCRYPT/SMIME flags.
	Using the latter sometimes resulted in the APPLICATION bit unset,
	which made oppenc unhappy.

	The send_menus previously used a switch statement using choice
	numbers. Since the menus now vary based on the oppenc option and
	message bit being set, these were all changed to convert the numbers
	back to a choice letter.

	* crypt.c, mutt.h, mutt_crypt.h, postpone.c, send.c, sendlib.c: Add a
	security bit to the message for oppenc mode.

	This allows oppenc to be enabled/disabled on a message level. If
	something initially enables encryption, such as crypt_autoencrypt or
	crypt_replyencrypt, oppenc is turned off for the message.

	Change the postpone/resume code to persist the oppenc bit.

	Also change resend message to enable and invoke oppenc if the option
	is set.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b38c4838976f)

	* compose.c, crypt.c, init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Add the
	crypt_opportunistic_encrypt option and calls.

	This patch creates the OPTCRYPTOPPORTUNISTICENCRYPT option and
	documentation.

	It also adds calls to crypt_opportunistic_encrypt() during initial
	message composition, after updating to, cc, or bcc, and after
	editing the message (if edit_headers is enabled).

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b10d0a945623)

	* crypt.c, mutt_crypt.h, send.c: Implement
	crypt_opportunistic_encrypt().

	This function will be called to flip encryption on and off based on
	message recipients.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (db2abe57adb5)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, pgp.c, pgp.h, pgpkey.c, smime.c: Implement
	oppenc_mode in the find_keys methods.

	oppenc_mode is used by crypt_opportunistic_encrypt to determine
	whether there are valid keys for all recipients of a message,
	without prompting the user.

	The patch wraps around prompts, and makes getkeybyaddr methods
	return a valid address-matching key without prompting.

	The patch also fixes a small problem with gpgme's getkeybyaddr. When
	determining if there were multiple strong matches, it was comparing
	the crypt_key_t instead of its kobj member (gpgme_key_t).

	The patch also enables a call to crypt_is_numerical_keyid() in
	find_keys(), so that crypt-hooks can actually be checked without
	prompting when gpgme is enabled. (The addition was patterned off of
	the pgp_findKeys() function).

	* crypt.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c: Pull is_numerical_keyid() into
	crypt.c.

	A subsequent patch (re?)-introduces a call to is_numerical_keyid
	inside find_keys(). Rather than duplicate the function, this patch
	pulls it into crypt.c, where find_keys() and pgp_findKeys() can both
	call it.

	crypt-mod.h, crypt.c, cryptglue.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c, pgp.h,
	smime.c, smime.h: Introduce an oppenc_mode parameter

	It's added to the parameter lists through the call stack down to the
	find_keys calls.

	No functionality is implemented yet. This patch is separated just to
	keep other patches more readable.

	crypt-mod.h, crypt.c, cryptglue.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c, pgp.h,
	smime.c, smime.h: Refactor the address list generation out of the
	find_keys routines.

	All four find_keys routines have a similar set up code for
	generating a single address list out of the to, cc, bcc lists. This
	patch pulls all the code into crypt_get_keys.

	This is done to simplify the functions before later patches make
	them more complicated (with the oppenc_mode parameter).

	* pgp.c: Fix pgp_application_pgp_handler to remove all tempfiles.

	If multiple PGP blocks are present in an email, Mutt only cleans up
	the tempfiles for the last block. Thanks to Dennis Preiser for the
	patch and sample mbox file demonstrating the problem.

	This patch also fixes the argument to mutt_perror for the pgpout
	tempfile.

	#3736)

	When a header has no value (*p == '\0' so l == 0), do not read
	outside the buffer but print the newline anyway when a tag is
	already printed (col != 0).

	Caught by ASAN while opening a draft with no Subject.

	* crypt-gpgme.c, crypt.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgpkey.c: Allow fingerprint
	user input for key selection. (see #3695)

	Accept and check input of a fingerprint and find the matching key.

	Note that for both to work, match against and display of
	fingerprint, the pgp_list_pubring_command and
	pgp_list_secring_command need to contain the
	--with-fingerprint option, or have with-fingerprint in
	~/.gnupg/gpg.conf.

	* contrib/gpg.rc, gnupgparse.c: Add fingerprint record parsing for pgp
	list keys. (see #3695)

	Modify parse_pub_line to parse fpr records and add the fingerprint
	to the pgp_key_t's fingerprint field.

	Add "--with-fingerprint --with-fingerprint" to the
	pgp_list_pubring_command and pgp_list_secring_command commands in
	contrib/gpg.rc. The second invocation generates fpr records for
	subkeys too.

	* pgplib.c, pgplib.h, pgppubring.c: Convert pgp_key_t fingerprint to a
	char* (see #3695)

	Currently only pgppubring.c is using the fingerprint field, and is
	using it to store a binary version of the fingerprint.

	Convert the field to store a null-terminated string. Modify
	pgppubring.c to use to use the new field.

	* pgpkey.c: Protect addr with NONULL in pgp_getkeybyaddr.

	This was introduced by bb3b01f41ed2, but wasn't included in the

2015-02-08 14:19 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (addd7cea01d4)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Cache uid validity in crypt_key_t.

	In order to find the validity for a crypt_key_t, the code has to
	loop through the key->kobj->uids list up to the correct index. This
	is a bit silly since the uid is available when the crypt_key_t is
	created in get_candidates().

	This patch adds a validity field, and changes the various places to
	use that instead of looping.

	Also fix a bug in _crypt_compare_trust(): it was using the validity
	of the first uid instead of the corresponding uid's validity.

2015-02-08 13:44 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7162033d1fb8)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix pgp-gpgme to set revoke/expired/disabled flags.

	The code wasn't settings those flags in get_candidates(). This patch
	adds it to the pgp path. I don't know if these flags apply to SMIME
	so am leaving them out for the smime branch.

	Fix up crypt_select_key() to follow the same logic as
	pgp_select_key().

	* contrib/smime.rc, init.h: Change the smime_encrypt_with default to
	aes256.

	Openssl supports -aes256 at least since 2004, and it's a stronger
	algorithm than des3.

	Also:
	- Remove the incorrect documentation comment about defaulting to 3des
	if unset.
	- Change the default set in contrib/smime.rc.

	* send.c: Protect SmimeDefaultKey for postpone/resume.

	PgpSignAs is saved and restored in ci_send_message(), but
	SmimeDefaultKey was not.

	Also, fix a bug where an empty PgpSignAs was not restored back to
	empty if the postponed email contained a SignAs value.

2015-02-02 13:25 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (3f4dc0ce66ae)

	* postpone.c: Fix mutt_parse_crypt_hdr() sign_as behavior.

	Currently, if a message is postponed with only the E encryption
	flag, when it is resumed, pgp_sign_as will be overwritten (with an
	empty string).

	This intention of the behavior was probably to restore the exact
	state of pgp_sign_as upon resuming. However, if the message wasn't
	marked for signing, the state of pgp_sign_as is not known. This
	patch changes the mutt_parse_crypt_hdr() to only set an empty
	pgp_sign_as if there is an S flag (and if set_empty_signas is true).

	mutt_edit_headers() also uses the function, but it doesn't want to
	overwrite pgp_sign_as with just an S flag. The set_signas parameter
	is renamed to (a hopefully clearer) "set_empty_signas".

	* imap/message.c, mailbox.h, mx.c, sendlib.c: Send the IMAP \Draft
	flag when postponing a message.

	This patch adds a mx_open_new_message() flag, M_SET_DRAFT. It also
	adds a MESSAGE->flags.draft flag.

	mutt_write_fcc() passes the M_SET_DRAFT flag to
	mx_open_new_message(), which then sets MESSAGE->flags.draft. Then,
	imap_append_message() is able to see this flag and so adds the
	\Draft flag.

	The imap_append_message() function started to have a bit too many
	flags, so this version of the patch separates out the flag
	generating code into a simpler version.

	* mutt_sasl.c: Clean up sasl warnings.

	These were caused by assigning callback functions to the
	sasl_callback_t.proc member. The callback type doesn't list any
	parameters, because parameters vary by callback. The fix was simply
	assigning a cast.

	Cyrus-sasl2 has a sasl_callback_ft typedef that their sample code
	uses for this purpose, but it is in a different header, saslplug.h,
	and isn't in their 1.5 tree. Since this is probably not portable to
	other implementations, I just added an equivalent cast.

2015-01-27 16:15 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (73b97b986e0d)

	* configure.ac, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Clean up gnutls warnings.

	Most of the warning were caused by deprecated types:
	gnutls_certificate_credentials gnutls_certificate_status
	gnutls_datum gnutls_digest_algorithm gnutls_session
	gnutls_transport_ptr gnutls_x509_crt Even though I believe the
	replacements have been around for a while, the patch adds autoconf
	checks and fallback typedefs.

	One warning was caused by casting an int to a pointer for the second
	parameter to gnutls_transport_set_ptr(). Recent gnutls has a
	replacement gnutls_transport_set_int() macro, but this macro simply
	(eventually) casts the parameter using
	"(gnutls_transport_ptr_t)(long)". So this patch just does the same.

	* crypt-gpgme.c, init.h, pgp.c: Remove GPG_AGENT_INFO check for GnuPG
	2.1 compatibility. (closes #3715)

	GnuPG version 2.1 stops exporting the GPG_AGENT_INFO environment
	variable, so mutt can't check for the presence of that to ensure the
	agent is running.

	For GPGME, we can check for the OpenPGP protocol being present. For
	classic pgp, we have to trust the user setting.

	This patch is based on the patches sent by CustaiCo and muffins.
	Thank you both for reporting the problem and creating a patch.

	This patch implements the make-key-attachment function for gpgme,
	modeled after the pgp version.

	It also adds an optional tempf parameter to
	data_object_to_tempfile() so the function can be reused for make-
	key-attachment.

	match loop.

	Since the key is invariant inside the address loop, there is no need
	to match against it with each address.

	All the keys should have at least one address record (see
	bb3b01f41ed2), but in case a record was malformed, add a check for
	that to keep the same logic.

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Allow short and long key ID user input in
	crypt_getkeybystr()

	The following did not work, e.g. when leaving a key list, and at the
	"Sign as" or "Encrypt to" prompt attempting to enter a key ID:
	* set pgp_long_ids=no
	  * enter a long key ID, with or without leading 0x
	* set pgp_long_ids=yes
	  * enter a short key ID without leading 0x

	Specifically entering a long key ID should always be possible as
	evil32.com has shown.

	This also cleans up the logic used to determine the matching
	condition, which was quite convoluted.. it even slightly speeds up
	the loop as less string operations are involved in the inner
	condition.

	This only changes how the result obtained from the crypt_* gpgme
	interface is filtered.

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix some context, data, and key memory leaks in
	gpgme.

	The context and data cleanup just involved adding missing
	gpgme_release() and gpgme_data_release() calls in a few places.

	The key usage was a little more involved:
	  * Fix crypt_free_key(). It wasn't freeing the key passed in, and
	didn't work properly if multiple keys were passed in. It also was
	missing a call to gpgme_key_unref().

	 * Add free_recipient_set() to properly unref all the keys before
	freeing the array.

	 * Fix get_candidates() to ref keys added to the crypt_key_t list,
	and unref the keys returned by gpgme_op_keylist_next().

	 * Change usages of gpgme_key_release() to gpgme_key_unref(). The
	former was deprecated in gpgme version 0.4.1 (2003-06-06).

	* doc/manual.xml.head, enter.c, history.c, history.h: Add a scratch
	buffer to the history ring. (closes #3082)

	This patch creates an extra slot in the history ring for a scratch
	buffer (at h->last). If you are editing inside that buffer, it is
	preserved when you scroll up/down through the history. Editing while
	in other places in history are *not* preserved with this patch.

	Another behavior change worth noting with this patch: the position
	in history is now reset to the scratch buffer after each input
	entry. Before, the position would be stay wherever it was - you
	didn't restart at the "bottom" each time.

	* globals.h, init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Add option to encrypt postponed
	messages. (closes #3665)

	This patch is based on Christian Brabandt's patch sent to mutt-
	users.

	Add two new configuration variables: $postpone_encrypt and
	$postpone_encrypt_as. When $postpone_encrypt is set and a message is
	marked for encryption, the message will be encrypted using the key
	specified in $postpone_encrypt_as before saving the message.

	In this patch, $postpone_encrypt_as must be specified. I
	experimented with passing safe_strdup( NONULL (PostponeEncryptAs))
	when unspecified, but although gpg.conf has a default-key setting, I
	could not get it to work properly. (pgpclassic gave an error message
	and gpgme sefaulted.)

	Although not necessary, this patch turns off signing during
	encryption of the postponed message (and turns it back on before
	saving), since there is no need to sign the message yet.

	* color.c, contrib/colors.default, contrib/colors.linux, curs_lib.c,
	doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head, mutt_curses.h: Add color
	type for prompts.

	This adds a new color type, MT_COLOR_PROMPT, that can be used to
	colorize prompts (fields, yes/no, multi_choice).

	Thanks to Ben Boeckel for the patch!

	* crypt-gpgme.c, pgp.c: Add gpg signature name. (closes #3478)

	Some mail clients display "noname" for the gpg signature attachment.
	This patch sets the mime name to "signature.asc".

	The patch is based on http://dev.mutt.org/trac/attachment/ticket/347
	8/gpg_signature_name.patch with the changes:
	  - removes the configuration options
	  - removes mime description

2014-12-31 20:35 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (31ce789af3df)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix segfault of extract-keys (^K) under gpgme.
	(closes #3698)

	This patch is based on the patch by Ben Price, which relocated the
	safe_fclose (&in) after its use by keydata in
	pgp_gpgme_extract_keys. Thank you for the patch!

	In addition, this patch:
	  * removes spurious (debug?) output when the extract keys is finished.
	  * adds a gpgme_data_release() call to free the keydata.

2014-10-10 14:17 +0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e7a77a6bfb84)

	* query.c: Fix a memory leak in mutt_query_complete.

	When a single result was returned, it was written to the buffer and
	returned, but the query result was never freed.

	This patch creates a free_query function and changes the code to use
	that everywhere.

2014-08-14 20:12 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c7f116b6dc20)

	$ac_cv_search_STRINGPREP_CHECK_VERSION should be
	$ac_cv_search_stringprep_check_version, to match the first parameter
	of the AC_SEARCH_LIBS([stringprep_check_version] above.

	Running configure was giving a "test: =: unary operator expected"
	error.

	* sendlib.c: Revert write_one_header() to skip space and tab. (closes
	#3716)

	This patch fixes CVE-2014-9116 in the stable branch. It reverts
	write_one_header() to the pre [f251d523ca5a] code for skipping
	whitespace.

	Thanks to Antonio Radici and Tomas Hoger for their analysis and
	patches to mutt, which this patch is based off of.

2015-01-05 18:28 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5a86319adad0)

	* pgpkey.c: Fix segv in pgp_getkeybystr(). (closes #3725)

	When searching for keys, and the user supplies "" to match against,
	pgp_getkeybystr will have values: p = ""; l = 0; After returning
	from pgp_select_key(), it will try to assign to p[l-1].

	(As a note, the function is chopping off and restoring the trailing
	"!" character because of ticket #1928.)

2015-01-03 11:33 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (79ea10b2d81c)

	* commands.c: Change bounce to use mutt_parse_adrlist() for address
	parsing.

	When prompting for recipients, forwarding, replying, and mailing all
	use mutt_parse_adrlist() to parse the addresses. This allows for
	addresses to be separated by spaces.

	Bounce message currently uses rfc822_parse_adrlist(), which doesn't
	allow the spaces. This one-line patch simply changes bounce to
	behave the same as mail, reply, and forwarding for the address
	prompt.

	Thanks to Roger Cornelius for the patch!

2014-12-31 20:35 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5530e9fb17d9)

2014-08-12 14:33 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (9a75aa4bd69e)

	* gnupgparse.c, pgpkey.c: Wrap pgp_uid_t->addr in NONULL(). (closes
	#3564)

	The previous patch introduced the possibility for addr to be null.
	Mutt is surprisingly robust against null strings, but there are a
	few places that should be wrapped in NONULL().

2014-08-12 14:33 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (bb3b01f41ed2)

	* gnupgparse.c: Fix parse_pub_line to allow an empty User-ID field for
	a pub record. (see #3564)

	A key whose primary uid record has an empty User-ID will result in
	the user being unable to use the key to encrypt an email in mutt.
	This is because the mutt functions for key selection iterate through
	the address fields of a key for matching against and for displaying
	to the user.

	This change allows a pgp_uid_t record to be created for a pub record
	whose User-ID field is blank. So the key will have one address
	record, albeit with a null addr field.

2013-11-02 20:12 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4909bd9c9149)

	* main.c: Override draft headers with arguments. (closes #3580)

	Currently, if the -H option is used, it is not possible to redefine
	the recipient addresses with positional argument. This patch fixes
	it as well as CC, Bcc, and Subject headers.

	This patch is based on the patch by Petr Písař at http://dev.mutt.or
	g/trac/attachment/ticket/3580/override_draft_headers_with_arguments.
	patch

	This version of the patch merges the To, Cc, and Bcc commandline
	arguments into the template, and fixes a few small problems with the
	previous patch.

	This patch also moves the fin close outside the "if (tempfile)"
	block, since it is opened outside that block.

2014-06-21 13:51 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (daf61444d454)

	* pgpinvoke.c: Enable %a format string for all pgp command configs.
	(closes #3699)

	Currently, the documentation states that, with the exception of
	pgp_getkeys_command, all the PGP format commands should be available
	to the pgp_*_command configuration variables.

	However, the %a format is actually only enabled for
	pgp_clearsign_command, pgp_encrypt_sign_command, and
	pgp_sign_command.

	Philip Rinn discovered this problem when he was trying to add a
	"--encrypt-to %a" to pgp_encrypt_only_command. Rather than just fix
	the one configuration he was having the problem with, this patch
	enables %a usage for all of them. (With the exception of the
	documented pgp_getkeys_command.)

2013-12-18 19:19 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (630bbc147022)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Note correct usage of $edit_headers. (closes
	#3673)

	Ticket 3673 shows that it isn't necessarily obvious a blank line is
	needed between the headers and body of a message when using
	$edit_headers. This patch adds a small note to the documentation,
	indicating the blank line should be preserved between the headers
	and body.

	Thank you Sinan Kaan Yerli for the patch.

2014-08-13 13:46 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (89b17d3cd510)

	* doc/mutt.man, doc/pgpring.man: Clarify PGPPATH usage in manpages.

	Make more clear that, when used with the original PGP program, mutt
	and pgpring rely on this being set.

2014-10-10 14:17 +0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (45fbc40193aa)

	* query.c: Fix a memory leak in mutt_query_complete.

	* postpone.c: Fix postpone/resume to not remove a Mail-Followup-To
	header (closes #3070)

	This solution changes mutt_prepare_template() to check whether the
	message_id field is NULL to decide whether to wipe the message-id
	and mail-followup-to headers when instantiating the message.

	If we are resending a message, we don't want the previous message-id
	and mail-followup-to headers. If we are resuming a postponed
	message, however, we want to keep the mail-followup-to header if any
	was set before the postpone. (grafted from

	Use local definitions of .EX/.EE or .DS/.DE to avoid low-level troff

	* attach.c: Fix segfault when viewing text attachments in compose
	menu. (closes #3644)

	The segfault was introduced in changeset b9f9e3147eb4. Since
	decoding and charset conversion aren't needed for attachments when
	composing a message, this patch reverts to just using
	mutt_save_attachment() to view "raw data" for text attachments in
	the compose/send case.

	This patch is based on Michael Elkins' patch at http://dev.mutt.org/
	trac/attachment/ticket/3644/view_attach_compose_segfault with just a
	missing return value check added.

	* commands.c, hook.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c: Ensure that BUFFER
	variables are initialized to prevent later attempts to traverse an
	uninitialized pointer.

	* commands.c, hook.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/message.c,
	init.c, keymap.c, pattern.c, score.c: Consistently use
	mutt_buffer_init function

	Despite the existence of the mutt_buffer_init function, most
	initializations were instead done with memset. Use the specific
	function instead to make it easier if later changes are made to how
	the initialization should be done.

	This patch addresses ticket 2788.

	Currently if you quit ('Q') from inside the pager, with quit=ask-yes
	or quit=ask-no, and you respond "no", mutt leaves you back in the
	index menu.

	This patch changes it so that mutt does not exit the pager.

	* configure.ac, version.sh: Use the directory where the version.sh
	script is located as the directory where it is run. Since this will
	be run in a separate shell anyway, there's no need to worry about
	changing current directory.

	This eliminates the need for the caller to specify where the source
	directory is located, and doesn't require that the code take special
	care to use the appropriate directory. The fallback method of using
	`cat VERSION` was broken in this respect, it would not work when run
	from a different directory.

	rfc1524.c, rfc822.c, send.c, sendlib.c, url.c: rename iswsp() to
	is_email_wsp()

	add new inline funtion skip_email_wsp() to be used in lieu of
	SKIPWS() when parsing ASCII protocols rather than user input.

	change use of SKIPWS() to skip_email_wsp() in places where it is
	likely to be a problem.

	* sendlib.c: fix problem where mutt_substrdup() was called with the
	start pointer > end pointer, as a result of using SKIPWS(). This
	occurred because the header field had an empty body, so the trailing
	newline was skipped over. The fix is to just skip over ascii space
	and htab.

	* .hgignore, Makefile.am, main.c, muttbug.sh.in, txt2c.c, txt2c.sh:
	Add compiler and configure info to mutt -v output (closes #3537)

	Makefile(.am) updated to produce conststrings.c, which contains C
	strings representing:

	* the compiler's own version information;
	* the CFLAGS value from the Make environment
	* the ./configure options

	main.c is updated to print them when running 'mutt -v'.

	txt2c.sh is added to produce conststrings.c. txt2c.sh uses a
	compiled txt2c binary if possible, for complete fidelity to the
	source strings in whatever encoding they may use. If txt2c is not
	available (could not be compiled, or was not compiled natively) it
	falls back on a shell function to approximate the output using sed
	and tr.

	Many structs used in mutt are actually constant but are defined
	without the 'const' keyword. This can slow initialization (slightly)
	in some environments due to extra copying and increases the amount
	of writable RAM required at run-time, which can be significant on
	non-MMU systems. Using const can also increase the opportunities for
	compiler optimization.

	The attached patch marks many such structures as const. On my test
	x86 build, this reduces the size of .data by over 50%.

	* hcache.c: Invalidate header caches when spam rules change. closes
	#3473

	User 'exg' on #mutt reported a problem when using header cache with
	IMAP and spam rules. Spam tags are retrieved from cache and not
	updated when spam rules change.

	1. Enable header caching in muttrc 2. Set spam rules in muttrc 3.
	Use IMAP (or POP or Maildir). Your spam rules store spam tags into
	your message headers, and these get cached. 4. Quit mutt 5. Change
	your spam rules in muttrc 6. Relaunch mutt 7. Because of header
	caching, the rfc822 headers are not reparsed, and spam rules are
	not reapplied. User has outdated spam tags.

	Spam rules are applied during rfc822 header parsing because it's the
	only time we get a full and unadulterated view of all headers. Once
	header parse is done we have only processed headers and 'user
	headers' (X-headers). We might do spam rule matching against the
	struct HEADER copy of headers, except that:

	a. the header might not be in HEADER if it's non-standard and not an
	X-header; b. spam rules are regular expressions matching any
	arbitrary header line, and we would need to map these regexps to
	the header used to create the HEADER fields. This would change
	the syntax and behavior of spam rules dramatically.

	One solution, perhaps stopgap, is to invalidate the header cache
	when spam rules change. That's what this patch does. It alters the
	hcache versioning algorithm so that in addition to using the
	compiled-in checksum of mutt's structures definitions, we also mix
	in the user's runtime spam rules. Any time spam rules change the
	hcachever hash value changes, causing the hcache to be rewritten.

	* configure.ac, dotlock.c, mutt.h, version.sh: Extra information in
	mutt version string, redux.

	Restores [f1b4d1d17200] functionality with a slight change to keep
	'make dist' working (see backout in [6b38124a5b81]).

	Automake is too much voodoo for me at this time, so I let it keep
	VERSION. mutt.h defined MUTT_VERSION as VERSION and the code used
	that, so I removed MUTT_VERSION from mutt.h and put it into config.h
	via configure.ac. A couple of tweaks were needed elsewhere. This
	restores the fancy-versioning feature within mutt and keeps 'make
	dist' happy.

2011-03-06 07:31 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (6b38124a5b81)

	* configure.ac, version.sh: Back out f1b4d1d17200. It is nice, but it
	breaks make dist.

2011-01-03 13:19 -0600  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (b107737c415c)

	* patchlist.sh: Include mq-based patches in the mutt patch list.

	This augments the contents of the PATCHES file, so that mq-based
	builds do not need to maintain that file.

	* configure.ac, version.sh: Include extra information in mutt version
	string for developer builds.

	When a build is based on an hg clone, include extra information
	about the changeset node, distance from a tagged release, and mq
	applied patch count.

	For example, after this patch is applied my mutt build identifies
	itself (in mutt -v and in <show-version>) as:

	Mutt 1.5.21+26,mq+22 (7edc2073390d) (2010-09-15)

	I have applied 26 changesets applied since 1.5.21 was tagged, 22 of
	which are in my mq patch series. A 1.5.21 release build that is not
	mercurial-based would still appear simply as "1.5.21".

	* send.c: Allow setting message security in send2-hook

	This patch delays checking the message security options until after
	the user has an initial chance to edit the message. This allows the
	security options to be set in a send2-hook when using $edit_headers.
	Without this patch, the user has no way of automatically setting
	security based on recipients since the to/cc prompts are bypassed.

	The other change in behavior is if the user happened to use a
	send2-hook to see if the message had security applied *prior* to
	editing the message, that no longer works.

	* keymap.c, keymap.h, main.c: support for ncurses extension allowing
	binding to function keys with modifiers

	* pattern.c: When regexp compilation fails, report actual pattern
	along with error.

	* muttlib.c: mutt_buffer_printf: NULL dptr means use data

	* pattern.c: If regcomp fails, assume rx has not been allocated. Fixes
	a core dump for save-hook '~f foo\.bar@(something|other)\.com' =foo.

	* copy.c: Guard dequote with NULL check on personal field

	* copy.c, rfc822.c, rfc822.h: Another attempt to dequote
	RFC2047-encoded address comments (see #2014)

	* rfc822.c: Backed out changeset 2a4ca6917fd0. It is incompatible with
	$assumed_charset (see #2014).

2010-02-01 23:40 -0800  Antonio Radici  <antonio@dyne.org>  (e9965b78e92d)

	* po/sv.po: The Swedish translation has a suboptimal
	translation of the word "Bad" in several places. The proposed patch
	substitutes Dålig (which implies bad "as in quality", and not bad
	"as in error") for Felaktig (erroneous).

	Closes #3370.

	* init.h: Small fix to the muttrc manpage. Closes #3374

2009-12-10 22:52 -0800  Daniel Jacobowitz  <dan@debian.org>  (b7d2cb7c7ce1)

	* hcache.c: Do not store header color in hcache. If the color
	directive is removed from muttrc, the cached value from the last
	directive would otherwise still be in effect.

2009-12-07 23:08 -0800  Patrick Welche  <prlw1@cam.ac.uk>  (1cf34ea1f128)

	* curs_main.c: Back out e67f4c347bb4.

	I could not reproduce the problem, and the change makes it
	impossible to change to a real folder when no folder is currently
	open.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: No-brain documentation typo fix Hi Rocco,

	Attached a patch for the documentation that fixes a small typo I
	stumbled upon. If you'd rather have me opening a trac ticket,
	please say so; since this is such a no-brainer I figured I'd e-mail
	you directly.

2009-08-17 17:07 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (d0fce0eec0b3)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head, init.h: Doc: fix more
	typos

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/mutt.pwl: Doc: fix aspell calls, add
	custom mutt-only wordlist

	* curs_main.c: Require already opened folder when using templates for
	change-folder.

	For example, start with -y and type a wrong IMAP password so that no
	mailbox is open. Trying to change folders resulted in a crash.

2009-08-14 21:29 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (6a08a5244d60)

	* pattern.c: Clear last search pattern if it's invalid.
	Closes #3315.

	We keep both, the string version and compiled version around for
	search-next; however, in case of parsing errors we dropped only the
	compiled version and not the string one making the code attempting
	to perform a search using a NULL pattern.

	* pattern.c: Bail on missing pattern modifiers at end of pattern.
	Closes #3314.

2009-08-13 23:49 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f8d50e968853)

	* doc/Muttrc.head, doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Docs: fix

	en_US spelling

2009-08-08 22:50 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (d4ea7f571f10)

	* buffy.c: Split out mailbox-specific code in mutt_buffy_check

	* buffy.c, muttlib.c, mx.c, mx.h, status.c: Unconditionally define
	M_IMAP, M_POP. These aren't bloat, and not having them creates a lot
	of #ifdef clutter.

	* curs_lib.c: Abort prompt on ^C, as was the case prior to
	12a6de725483

2009-08-04 10:47 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (15a695678b7b)

2009-08-01 15:16 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (29727d19634a)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: use full names for &eacute; and
	&egrave; entities. Closes #3286.

	This is necessary because we want to install a us-ascii manual.txt
	that would contain only "e" instead of accented characters.

2009-07-30 17:56 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4a572310c3b5)

2009-07-28 23:16 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (153eac9e03e7)

	* Makefile.am: Add group.h to distribution

2009-07-27 20:49 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (5c076ed18883)

	* configure.ac: Do not overwrite docdir unless --with-
	docdir was explicitly given. This allows --docdir from autoconf
	2.60+ to work, though if given --with-docdir will silently override
	--docdir. Closes #3282.

2009-07-24 14:30 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (86e066a206ac)

2009-07-23 23:51 +0200  Matthias Andree  <matthias.andree@gmx.de>  (1e77b368ef55)

	* charset.h, rfc2047.c: Use proper prototype for
	mutt_get_default_charset(), fix fallout.

	* bcache.c, charset.c: Fix two warnings "the address of 'foo' will
	always evaluate as 'true'".

2009-07-23 17:28 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (1597c2074a52)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: better document what address
	groups are (for)

	* group.c, group.h, init.c, init.h, pattern.c, protos.h, rfc822.c,
	rfc822.h: Implement ungroup command. Closes #3304.

	* init.c, mutt.h, muttlib.c: Move remove_from_rx_list() to muttlib.c,
	name it mutt_remove_from_rx_list()

2009-07-22 15:25 +0200  Fabian Groffen  <grobian@gentoo.org>  (d41e043fa775)

	* keymap.c: Use CRYPT_BACKEND_GPGME instead of non-existent

2009-07-22 14:43 +0200  kees  <kees@outflux.net>  (848f08512bf3)

	* hcache.c, rfc822.h: Properly restore addresses from hcache using

	* mh.c: Don't leak mhs flags in mh_buffy(). Closes #3303.

2009-07-17 17:57 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (a3c4b605cfad)

	* UPDATING: add batch mode send-hooks note to UPDATING

2009-07-14 20:25 -0700  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (084fb086a0e7)

	* send.c: Make send-hooks work for batch mode. Closes
	#3219.

	Handle SENDBATCH inline with the normal sending code, instead of
	handling it separately. This allows send-hooks to run, along with
	removing a number of unnecessarily lines of code.

2009-07-11 14:52 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (6f942afe60b5)

	* charset.c, mbyte.c: Recognize charset extensions, see #3150.

	With utf-8//TRANSLIT, we internally didn't recognize it as utf-8.
	This leads to badly broken behaviour if --without-wc-funcs is used
	for some reason. In that case, if we have utf-8 as charset, we
	implement our own wide char functions; for all other charsets, we
	use the system single-byte locale functions. And using these with
	utf-8 is broken.

	* curs_lib.c: Render blanks to spaces in index, fixes
	[298194c414f0]

	wcwidth(<tab>) returns -1 so 'foo<tab>bar' was rendered to 'foobar',
	and now to 'foo bar'. Closes #3270 again.

2009-07-08 13:37 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f22b71d8005a)

	* UPDATING, bcache.c, doc/manual.xml.head, hcache.c,

	#3284.

	* UPDATING, globals.h, init.h, sendlib.c: Add $wrap_headers. Closes
	#3135

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: mention terminal setup for

2009-07-02 00:06 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (029ba140fb48)

	* curs_main.c: Handle keepalive failure when changing folders. There
	are probably many other places where this kind of thing could happen
	though. See #3028.

2009-07-01 18:13 -0700  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f6c6066a5925)

	* account.c, mutt_sasl.c, smtp.c: Make getuser/pass abort
	if input is required in batch mode. Replaces [0a3de4d9a009]. See
	#3289.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add detailed section on charset
	handling

	* smtp.c: SMTP: use $smtp_pass in batch mode. Closes #3289.

	mutt_account_getpass() copying the password from $smtp_pass into the
	account structure is only called from the SASL callback we only use
	if we're sure we don't need curses (i.e. have the pass already).

2009-06-30 17:32 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f4baa2f1251a)

	* pgpewrap.c: Add missing config.h include to pgpewrap.c

	It technically doesn't need it, but pgpewrap should be rebuilt after
	configure ran, too.

	* doc/Makefile.am: Manual: Run lynx with --display_charset
	=us-ascii, see #3286.

2009-06-29 18:20 +0000  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (03c65df651e0)

	* UPDATING, doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Move new mail detection into
	its own section

	This also updates some parts of docs and adds missing ones. It also
	adds a note about the recent changes, also to UPDATING.

2009-06-29 18:03 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (d3a7e0334e5d)

	* url.c, url.h: Revert URL path encoding for now

	It breaks gmail url display and makes bcache use different paths.
	Still we need to think about whether we want to allow any character
	in bcache paths (possibly multibyte, possibly depending on
	$charset).

2009-06-28 20:49 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (298194c414f0)

	* configure.ac, curs_lib.c: Allow tabs in index subject. Closes #3270.

	* imap/util.c: Allow ImapDelimChars to be unset

	* mutt.h: Rename struct thread to struct mutt_thread. Closes #3279.

	* imap/command.c: Not being able to start an IMAP command
	is a fatal error. Closes #3155.

	* imap/auth_login.c: IMAP LOGIN does not support separate user and
	login accounts. Use the user account for both. Closes #3240.

2009-06-27 17:07 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (7ca8d09f7d2c)

	* hg-commit: hg-commit: drop changelog entries from hg log

	* doc/makedoc.c, doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: stop using DocBook
	entities mapping to ascii chars

	There's no real benefit, it only makes reading/writing the manual
	harder. All entities that potentially map to non-ascii characters
	(&mdash, &auml, etc.) are left so that manual.xml remains pure

	* doc/mutt.css: CSS update for newer docbook xslt versions

	* pager.c: pager: intermediate fix for wrapping long header lines with
	$smart_wrap set

	The header folding algorithm outputs a word without spaces and
	longer than $wrap as-is. The pager however tries to break it. With
	$smart_wrap unset, it simply breaks at $wrap regardless if there's a
	space or not. With $smart_wrap set it tried to find a space and
	break if the next word is too long. This logic doesn't work for
	folded header lines which always start with space. Thus, the output
	would always contain the folding whitespace on a line by itself
	detaching the header value from the header name.

	As an intermediate fix we don't try to be smart if the line begins
	with space or tab.

	* pager.c, sendlib.c: pager: Ignore $wrap for attachment markers

	* send.c: Treat address groups as no recipients

	When sending with Sendmail or SMTP we exclude address groups anyway,
	so treat these addresses as not present when checking for valid

	* smtp.c: SMTP: Don't send "undisclosed-recipients" in RCPT TO

	This happened for Bcc only messages. "undisclosed-recipients" is
	added in To: as guard against MTAs that leak BCCs if no To:/Cc:
	header is given. See Debian #529090.

	* init.h: Document that $pager_context affects searching, too

	* UPDATING: Update UPDATING

	* handler.c: Turn trailing \r\n to \n for qp-encoded messages.

	RFC2045 (sect. 6.7, (1) general 8bit representation) states that
	neither CR nor LF of the trailing CRLF may be qp-encoded. So we
	ignore trailing qp-encoded CRs.

	See #2898 though this is a partial fix only.

	* pager.c: Give $pager_context lines of context when searching
	page-based menus. Closes #976.

	* handler.c, init.h, rfc3676.c: f=f: Strip trailing spaces for
	interoperability. Closes #3001.

	If we make a fixed reply to a flowed message we remove trailing
	spaces and can now safely allow $indent_string to be used which is
	what users expect.

	Second, if we make a flowed reply to a fixed message we also strip
	trailing spaces since from format=fixed we assume all lines are
	fixed (i.e. we don't want to errorneously make fixed lines flowed).

	* handler.c, init.h, mutt.h: Add $honor_disposition to not display
	attachments inline. Closes #3170.

	Previously all MIME parts were displayed inline regardless of the
	Content-Disposition header (if present). With $honor_disposition
	set, only inline parts are displayed inline, attachments can only be
	viewed from the attachments menu.

	* history.c, init.c, lib.c, lib.h, mh.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c, pgp.c,
	query.c, rfc1524.c, smime.c: Add flags to mutt_read_line() for
	EOL-stripping and continuation support

	We use these to stop supporting EOL-escaping with \ which was wrong
	in most cases (e.g. $history_file), support is kept for reading
	config and mailcap files.

	Leaving CRLF in will be used for the pager.

	* menu.c, pager.c, pattern.c: Fall back to search if no query exists
	for search-(next|opposite)

	The pager had the fall-through to search, so for consistency do that
	in other menues as well.

	* pager.c: Fix pager search prompt for reverse search

	When doing a reverse search for the first time after switching to
	the pager, SearchBack is always 0 and thus gave the wrong prompt,
	change to using op directly. While I'm at it, unify search prompts.

2009-05-25 17:31 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (8f11dd00c770)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Fix a serious oversight validating TLS
	certificates. If any certificate in a chain presented by a server
	was accepted, the connection was allowed without verifying that the
	presented certificate was actually signed by the certificate in the
	chain.

2009-05-27 22:13 -0700  Petr Písař  <petr.pisar@atlas.cz>  (05bc65d6ae70)

	* po/cs.po: Updated Czech translation.

	#3237.

2009-05-26 17:57 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (392e945dfba7)

	<view-attach>. Closes #3234.

2009-05-25 15:57 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (3f0963dd9257)

	* attach.c, recvattach.c: Don't loose error message when attachment
	saving fails. Closes #3156.

	* UPDATING, color.c, doc/manual.xml.head: Make "uncolor" also work
	header and body objects. Closes #1046.

2009-05-13 14:20 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f96a176bb14c)

	* send.c: Don't set 'replied' flag if user changes
	References/IRT. Closes #2044.

	* mutt.h, muttlib.c: Add mutt_find_list() to lookup data in lists

	* alias.c, crypt-gpgme.c, group.c, mbox.c, pgp.c, query.c,
	rfc822.c, rfc822.h, send.c, smime.c: Prune empty address groups
	when preparing replies. Closes #2875.

	* mbox.c: Actually reopen mbox/mmdf files in case we find
	modifications. Closes #2725.

	Since the file is changed while we have it open in ctx->fp, we
	likely get wrong information when parsing the mailbox. Now we
	explicitely close and (re)open it.

2009-05-12 16:26 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (06e318bfe8f2)

	* mbox.c: Backout errorneously commited mbox atime fix

2009-04-29 14:49 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (335e6f782862)

	* browser.c: Fix maildir times in mailboxes browser. Closes #626.

	Instead of using the (pointless) mtime of the top-level maildir
	folder, use the latest mtime of the "new" and "cur" subdirectories.
	Maildir folders in the mailboxes list can now be properly sorted by
	date. This does not affect the directory browser. Also see #2421.

	* mailbox.h, mh.c, mx.c: Move Maildir/MH folder detection from
	mx.c to mh.c

2009-04-28 15:12 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4d9685be5987)

	* sendlib.c: Fold References: header so we never run into line length
	problems

	* headers.c: Fix comment typo

2009-04-28 14:18 +0200  Bertram Felgenhauer  <int-e@gmx.de>  (6b20a3545f03)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, headers.c: Drop References header if In-Reply-
	To is modified by user. Closes #3221.

2009-04-28 13:05 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (a13d8fd40094)

	* send.c: Don't generate References: for reply to multiple
	messages

	All parent Message-Ids are present in In-Reply-To already. Also,
	RfC2822, section 3.6.4 discourages its generation.

	* sendlib.c: Don't trim In-Reply-To with $edit_headers set

	In case of a tagged reply to several messages, we want In-Reply-To
	to contain all parent Message-Ids.

	* imap/imap.c: Only sync changed messages back to hcache on
	mailbox sync

	* doc/manual.xml.head: For spam detection, mention $imap_headers.
	Closes #3223.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fix typo and reword paragraph

2009-04-26 21:09 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (9fa4a3e74355)

	* UPDATING, doc/manual.xml.head, pop.c: POP: Support hcache updating,
	too.

	This also allows us to use hcache to manage "flagged" and "replied"
	message flags.

	* imap/imap.c, mh.c: Sync header to hcache when synching
	MH/Maildir/IMAP folders. Closes #2942.

	* pager.c: Use dynamic buffer for displaying pager lines. Closes
	#3162.

	With too small fixed-size buffers we can't color/find certain words
	that span buffers. This needs to duplicate mutt_read_line with the
	adjustment to leave line termination in and not support breaking
	long lines using \ at EOL. Other callers may want to use this one
	instead, too as we support \-escaping in too many places.

	* init.h: Document suffixes for %f in $folder_format

2009-04-22 23:29 +0200  Bertram Felgenhauer  <int-e@gmx.de>  (0aa313a3bf20)

	* headers.c: Fix memory leak in mutt_edit_headers(). Closes #3220.

	* configure.ac, mkdtemp.c, protos.h: Add mkdtemp() from xfce to
	unbreak gpgme build on Solaris. Closes #3217.

2009-04-25 10:35 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (c6de4f51b8c7)

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, protos.h, strcasestr.c: Add strcasestr()
	from uclibc to unbreak (Open)Solaris build. Closes #3222.

2009-04-21 15:10 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (3d89eddb2d9a)

	* buffy.c: Equivalent mutt_buffy, but readable code

	* buffy.c, buffy.h: Call mutt_expand_path() from mutt_buffy to fix
	imap separator. Closes #3208 and #3218

	* buffy.c: Use slen instead of assuming _POSIX_PATH_MAX

2009-04-23 12:51 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (b5b4e652e4b1)

	* ChangeLog, po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2009-04-20 18:36 +0200  Christoph Berg  <cb@df7cb.de>  (39fee3a9d034)

	can't work with $autoedit. Closes #1834.

2009-04-20 18:26 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (6cc887ccd229)

	* init.h: Fix typo for $imap_pass

2009-04-17 18:05 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (7d44a83efcc6)

	* pgp.c: Support the Charset: armor header for inline PGP. Closes
	#3039.

	The header is defined as optional by RfC4880.

	This is based on patch-1.5.9.tamo.pgp_charsetchack.1. We only
	support reading this header and, if present, recode the PGP output
	from the given charset to $charset if we find it valid; otherwise
	fall back to UTF-8. Certain clients make use of the header when
	sending mail, so mutt should respect it because some messages are
	otherwise unreadable.

	The sending side is not touched, we unconditionally send UTF-8.

2009-04-17 15:45 +0200  Michael Elkins  <me@mutt.org>  (61a0c67ed727)

	* sendlib.c: Make sure Recent-From: consults $realname.  Closes
	#1721.

2009-04-17 15:37 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (3a7ecc3f8aeb)

	* UPDATING, functions.h, pager.c: Make <set-flag> and <clear-flag>
	work in the pager, too. Closes #3212.

	* pager.c: Don't consider \n part of a line for body
	coloring. Closes #2363.

	* attach.c: Enlarge buffer size for parsing mailcap files

	We really need code for dynamic buffers which would solve a few
	other bugs, too. Closes #2205.

2009-04-16 19:23 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (a4f66ae72dc5)

	* ChangeLog, pop_lib.c: POP: Default to using getservbyname() as we do
	for IMAP and SMTP

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Improve docs on URL syntax, add
	examples

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add user-defined variables to variable

	* hdrline.c: For %F, display Bcc recipient if no other recipients
	found. Closes #3157.

	* UPDATING, doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head, pattern.c:
	Make ~x match In-Reply-To, too. Closes #771.

	* sendlib.c: Fix b5cbd0dab863, closes #3215.

	Still valgrind reports 'fromcode' as leaking.

2009-04-07 11:32 +0200  Erik Hovland  <erik@hovland.org>  (d344c6429a48)

	* sendlib.c: Try to correct usage of tempfile and *tempfile

	Since tempfile is a double pointer checking for tempfile and then
	dereferencing with *tempfile is not correct.

2009-04-06 22:05 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (d639baaf57fb)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fix typo

2009-04-06 19:10 +0200  Erik Hovland  <erik@hovland.org>  (4fe35e9984ba)

	* sendlib.c: mutt_message_to_7bit(): Only close file
	pointer if we opened it

	The pointer is to be managed outside the function and provided. Only
	close it we opened it ourself using fopen().

2009-04-06 19:07 +0200  Erik Hovland  <erik@hovland.org>  (b5cbd0dab863)

	* sendlib.c: Plug memory leaks in sendlib.c

2009-04-05 13:41 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (5d393e716c51)

	* init.h, sendlib.c: Backed out changeset 23c7b469ff20

	This requires more thought: if the user has -- in $sendmail, we need
	to add our arguments for 8BITMIME/DSN/etc. before it and not after.
	See #3168.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Make sure every rc command has a
	synopsis in its describing section

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fold consecutive <cmdsynopsis/>
	into just one

	This make it visually easier to spot what belongs together.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: More entities and <quotes/> as
	appropriate

	Capitalize headlines

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Move section on mixmaster support to

	* init.h, sendlib.c: Only append -- to $sendmail if not
	present. Closes #3168.

	This allows users to add custom recipients via $sendmail.

2009-04-02 12:57 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (bfb12cf02417)

	* init.h: Clarify what $attach_charset does, closes #3165.

	This should be used from time to time to check if vars are sorted.

	Closes #3191.

	* init.h: Sort $pgp_* and $crypt_* vars, see #3191.

	* init.h: Sort $smime_* vars, see #3191.

	multiple accounts using folder-hook

	* UPDATING, doc/manual.xml.head, mutt.h, pattern.c: Perform case

	...since we do that for regex patterns already. It doesn't work for
	IMAP server-side searches.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fix markup of ".muttrc"

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Always spell mutt as "Mutt"

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Replace netscape with firefox

	option types

	* doc/makedoc.c: makedoc: make output slightly more readable

	* hash.c, hash.h, init.c, mh.c, thread.c: Restore $reverse_alias
	feature by using case-insensitive hash keys

	The fix is implemented as callbacks in the hash table so we can
	avoid working with copies of the mailbox keys but work on the
	originals instead and don't pollute the code with lower-case

	While I'm at it, turn int hashes into unsigned values since the hash

	With ee5e696a9d08 we would skip beyond the filename to look for a
	description. This changeset fixes it.

	* main.c: Set magic from -m before processing queries (-Q) or dumping
	variables (-D)

	* doc/mutt.man, init.h: Better document how the initial folder is
	determined. Closes #3189.

2009-02-15 16:09 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (ee5e696a9d08)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, headers.c: Support spaces in Attach:
	pseudoheader. Closes #3179.

	* imap/imap.c: IMAP: only close socket when not already
	disconnected.

2009-01-27 18:48 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (d7e44862a08a)

	* help.c, main.c, mh.c: Update copyright years

	* help.c: Fix help alignment for escape sequences at screen
	boundary. Closes #3146.

	* mh.c: Unconditionally inode-sort Maildir and MH folders. Closes
	#3166.

2009-01-26 12:32 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (da94a92c3ba0)

	* bcache.c: Remove old bcache tmpfile before trying to create new
	one. Closes #3163.

2009-01-20 12:34 -0800  René Clerc  <rene@clerc.nl>  (2006526d1d26)

	imap_munge_mbox_name+imap_unquote_string.

2009-01-14 11:45 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (cd0b17c80372)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Add missing hooks to manual section 4

2009-01-13 06:51 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (10e224e86f0b)

	* hook.c: Do not allow a command in an account-hook to trigger another
	account-hook. Recent changes in the IMAP path canonifier mean that
	account-hooks that set variables to URLs (eg folder, spoolfile) can
	trigger a recursive account-hook. Now we just bail out of account-
	hook early if we are called recursively, but perhaps we should warn
	the user to use a folder-hook instead. Thanks to Kyle Wheeler for
	finding this one.

2009-01-12 10:27 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (6976aca75d04)

2009-01-10 22:09 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (db3a61fcde35)

	comparing them.

	* imap/util.c: Fix last commit

	* imap/util.c: Prioritize the entered IMAP folder delimiter. First
	priority is the connection delimiter. Second priority is the user's
	delimiter if it is in imap_delim_chars. We no longer use the first
	character in imap_delim_chars.

2009-01-06 18:34 -0800  Vsevolod Volkov  <vvv@mutt.org.ua>  (4032dfd52118)

2009-01-04 17:04 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (d98ab9a591e5)

	* pgpkey.c: Remove dead code. Thanks to Ingo Schwarze.

	rfc2047.c, rfc2231.c, rfc3676.h, send.c, setenv.c, status.c,
	url.c: Update copyrights. Closes #3016. I went through the logs of
	each file with a copyright header and updated the years for the
	authors in the headers for any non-comment changes they
	introduced. What a pain!

	Updated copyrights

	* smtp.c: SMTP: complain when authentication fails. Closes
	#2117. Now each failed attempt emits an error before mutt tries
	the next method. Possibly we should just fail immediately?

	* parse.c, snprintf.c: Use ! instead of testing pointers against 0.

2009-01-04 20:12 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (33fa1ca4b6af)

	* doc/gen-map-doc, init.h: Documentation: Minor fixes and

	to Ingo Schwarze.

	* doc/Makefile.am: Remove obsolete reference to ChangeLog.old. Thanks
	to Ingo Schwarze.

	* imap/message.c: Ignore unexpected FETCH responses during
	imap_read_headers. Thanks to Chris Li for the excellent bug report
	in #3041. See #2902, #2935, #2985, #3028, #3041, #3143. With luck,
	this may close them. In truth, imap_read_headers is still a horrible
	kludge of duct tape and chicken wire.

	* hash.c, hash.h: Make hash_string work in unsigned domain

	* main.c: Another copyright update

	* main.c, smtp.c: Update some copyrights

2009-01-02 23:13 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (87ef3e3550e4)

	* smtp.c: SMTP: Use Hostname if Fqdn is bogus. Closes #3142.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Tyops

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Add SSL intermediate certificate support for
	gnutls

	immediately if a certificate is interactively accepted.  Display
	index of current certificate in chain in menu title.

2009-01-02 12:46 -0800  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (5db868a874b6)

	* globals.h, mutt_ssl.c: Add support for intermediate certificates to
	openssl code. Gnutls support is not included in this patch.

2009-01-01 17:02 -0800  Marcel Telka  <marcel@telka.sk>  (532f695b4352)

	* smtp.c: SMTP: Require SP after AUTH response (strict RFC
	conformance). Closes #3141.

2009-01-01 16:55 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (859009a507d8)

	* smtp.c: SMTP: guard against short server responses

2008-12-30 00:58 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (ac870203179d)

2008-12-16 20:19 -0800  Erik Hovland  <erik@hovland.org>  (f6ae8dc70850)

	pgpmicalg.c, pgppacket.c, postpone.c, query.c, recvattach.c,
	recvcmd.c, send.c: Remove unused #include directives

	* sendlib.c: mutt_gen_msgid() allocates the msgid off of the heap.

	Since mutt_gen_msgid() allocates the msgid string with strdup, it is
	getting it off of the heap.

	When the fprintf writes the msgid, the string is no longer tracked
	and that string is leaked.

	* parse.c: Match variable type to getch return type

	* alias.c: Fix fread rc check

	* hash.c: Remove redundant int clamping

	* smime.c: Remove check that always succeeds

	see #3109.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: trim into chapter, add notes about
	contributing

	* doc/mutt.css: Make mutt.css apply for all media types

	* doc/manual.xml.head, doc/mutt.css: Manual: Wrap important notes
	in <note/>

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/chunk.xsl, doc/html.xsl, doc/mutt.xsl: Move
	common XSLT params to mutt.xsl imported into (chunk|html).xsl

	* doc/gen-map-doc, doc/makedoc.c, doc/manual.xml.head,
	doc/manual.xml.tail, init.h: Manual: Only wrap real text
	paragraphs in <para/>

	Elements such as lists, tables, synopsis don't need it and produce
	hundreds of warnings in tidy because of empty paragraphs.

	With this change, the manual should be fully XHTML 1.0 Transitional
	and validate without warnings and errors.

	* hg-commit: hg-commit: Work even in subdirectories

	* doc/chunk.xsl, doc/html.xsl: Manual: Use right XSLT-way to embed
	CSS to avoid invalid xmlns="" attributes on <style/>

	* doc/devel-notes.txt: devel-notes.txt: add some words about preparing
	& contributing patches

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add section about typographical
	conventions, see #3109.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, doc/mutt.css: Manual: Wrap important examples
	in <example/>

2008-12-06 15:06 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (e13e903af3bf)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, doc/mutt.css: Manual: Fixup configuration
	command synopsis and switch to <cmdsynopsis/>

	* doc/makedoc.c: makedoc: use <quote/> and <literal/> in string
	default values

	The goal is to improve readability of settings where spaces are
	relevant.

	Manual: Add simple and clean stylesheet, see #3109.

2008-11-30 20:28 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (cb251bde7fc1)

	* addrbook.c, browser.c, compose.c, crypt-gpgme.c, curs_main.c,

	pgpkey.c, postpone.c, query.c, recvattach.c, remailer.c, smime.c:
	Manage last search pattern outside of menu lifecycle

	Previously, the pattern was thrown away during menu destruction. For
	the next search, mutt then can't provide a good suggestion. The new
	behaviour is to manage the pattern outside the lifecyle to always
	provide the last pattern as suggestion.

	* query.c: Start numbering query results with 1 instead of 0

2008-11-24 11:44 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (fd555f9fcb03)

	* doc/Makefile.am: Complete e1304a641938 commit

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/db-cleanup.xsl: Manual: Convert manual.html

	This ensures manual.txt is always pure ASCII and removes the
	horrible XSLT-based and incomplete hack.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fix wording for simple search

2008-11-22 18:09 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (0837f7b13990)

	undefined). Closes #3131.

2008-11-15 19:51 -0800  Alexey I. Froloff  <raorn@altlinux.org>  (af87aa1846be)

	* md5.c, md5.h: md5.h, md5.c: updated to latest version from gnulib.
	Buggy old md5.h causes problems with gcc 4.3 compiler. In md5.h
	__attribute__ is #define'd to no-op and causes mutt_md5 to enter
	inifinite loop while calling memcpy().

2008-11-15 19:36 -0800  Gary Johnson  <garyjohn@spk.agilent.com>  (01e4deee6827)

	* pager.c: Restart pager search from top if called twice.  Do not
	loop infinitely. Closes #3127.

2008-10-30 01:02 +0100  Emanuele Giaquinta  <e.giaquinta@glauco.it>  (6c58b678d360)

	* account.c: Remove unused variable in mutt_account_match and fix
	comment.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.h, imap/util.c: Add imap_account_match

	purpose.

	According to SUS, the st_size member of struct stat is undefined for
	directories. In case a system reports 0, the newly_created flag will
	be set for a directory and the magic will be cleared.

	If the folder type is cleared, mutt won't check the folder for new
	mail and thus will ignore MH and Maildir type folders on such a fs
	completely (e.g. the HAMMER fs on DragonFly BSD).

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:
	The msgset changes seem buggy. Reverting pending further testing.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:
	Split long IMAP commands for the benefit of lazy servers (closes
	#3000). Also touches lots of old, hairy code. Likely to wake
	sleeping dogs.

	* imap/util.c, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_ssl.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c:
	Properly set the SASL external auth name when using SSL client
	certs. Also zero out the account structure before filling it with
	available data. Client certificates + SASL EXTERNAL were only
	working by luck.

	* imap/imap.c: Remove leftover IMAP IDLE handling from before
	[53d9210aa4ee].

	* UPDATING, globals.h, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c, init.c, init.h: Introduce
	$imap_pipeline_depth. This lets users control the number of
	commands that mutt will queue up before sending them to the
	server. Setting this to 0 disables pipelining, which should close
	#2892.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:
	Rework IMAP command queueing to allow pipelining to be disabled.
	IDLE handling has been better abstracted, and there are fewer entry
	points to the IMAP command issuing machinery. Any commands that are
	simply queued may be executed whenever the pipeline fills, instead
	of requiring explicit handling in the caller.

	Tested on my Cyrus server, but I wouldn't be surprise if this causes
	new problems.

	* pager.c: Ignore zero width characters U+200B/U+FEFF which may garble
	the display. Closes #3061, #3048.

	* charset.c, charset.h, init.c: Validate charset names for all
	charset options. Validation is either done against mutt's table of
	IANA assigned names or local iconv implementation (based on the
	assumption that iconv_open(charset,charset) fails if charset is
	unknown to the implementation). Closes #1668.

2008-07-10 09:38 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (d3ee9644765f)

	* copy.c: Fix three bugs handling flags in mutt_copy_header

	1. mutt_copy_header incorrectly tests CH_UPDATE to determine whether
	to write the In-Reply-To and References headers. CH_UPDATE
	refers only to Status: and X-Status:

	2. mutt_copy_header ignores CH_NOSTATUS which is supposed to
	indicate that the mailbox type doesn't use those headers.

	3. mutt_copy_header tests h->env->irt_changed and
	h->env->refs_changed when it should be testing CH_UPDATE_IRT and
	CH_UPDATE_REFS, respectively. Early in the function this
	happens:

	 if (h->env) flags |= (h->env->irt_changed ? CH_UPDATE_IRT
	: 0) | (h->env->refs_changed ? CH_UPDATE_REFS : 0);

	 This means that for most callers, the result is the same, but
	mutt_copy_header should be testing the flags because the caller
	might have set them explicitly without setting
	irt_changed/refs_changed.

	* parse.c, protos.h, send.c: Unify parser for message-ids

	Rewrite mutt_extract_message_id and change mutt_parse_references to
	us it. The parser in mutt_extract_message_id is looser than the old
	one in mutt_parse_references; it just looks for <[^\s>]+> and
	doesn't worry about @-signs. Additionally it doesn't use strtok, so
	the input string can be const.

	Closes #3090, #1935, #1116 (both the stated bug and the conversation
	following).

2008-08-11 16:42 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (508ffc26dad2)

	* copy.c: Clean up error handling in mutt_copy_header

	mutt_copy_header unnecessarily tests the result of each fputc/fputs

	ferror/feof are checked at the bottom of the function, and get rid

	* curs_main.c: Calculate menu->max after a possible resort in index
	(maybe changing number of messages). Closes #3088.

	* curs_lib.c: Fix casts for progress update to prevent -ftrapv
	aborts to trigger. Closes #3018.

2008-07-02 08:56 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (c51c16db46cc)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Only make LC_MESSAGES conditional on NLS in GPGME
	locale support.

2008-07-02 11:19 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (8b783c916893)

	* browser.c, buffy.c, commands.c, compose.c, curs_main.c, enter.c,
	headers.c, hook.c, imap/imap.c, init.c, mbox.c, muttlib.c,
	postpone.c, protos.h, recvattach.c, send.c, status.c: Use
	realpath() in mutt_pretty_mailbox() for paths that may need
	it. This requires to add the buffer size as parameter since the
	result may be longer than the original but still fit in the
	buffer. Closes #2948.

	* hash.c: Use casts to avoid triggering integer overflow detection in
	hash function

2008-07-01 20:06 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (fb0df4ae0836)

	* ChangeLog, curs_lib.c: Clamp timeval math to unsigned int to match
	progress timestamps. This is fine since only relative differences
	matter. Closes #3018.

2008-07-01 18:29 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (f9af0501d2dd)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Set GPGME locale on first attempt to create context.
	Closes #2913.

	* crypt-gpgme.c, crypt-gpgme.h, crypt-mod-pgp-gpgme.c: Stub in a
	gpgme version of extract-keys. It doesn't currently work right
	because apparently while gpg on the command line can parse a whole
	message, we'll have to do it for gpgme. I really wonder about the
	'ME' part of GPGME sometimes.

	* crypt-gpgme.c, lib.c, lib.h: Support displaying application/pgp-keys
	with GPGME. This was pretty convoluted because GPGME provides no way
	to examine a key block without importing it. This code creates a
	temporary GPG home in which to import the key in order to display
	it.

	* crypt-gpgme.c, handler.c, pgp.c: Handle DONTHANDLEPGPKEYS in
	handler instead of crypto modules. This lets gpgme and classic pgp
	share a bit of logic, and unbreaks key extraction at least for
	classic PGP.

	* copy.c: Bail out of copy if decryption is requested but the desired
	engine is missing. This closes #2684, but handling of mixed crypto
	in a single message needs more investigation.

2008-07-01 01:10 -0700  rtc  <rtc@gmx.de>  (49fe0292b503)

	* copy.c: When deleting attachments, always print newline
	separating header from body. Closes #3085.

2008-06-29 01:09 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (677e7712d735)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Improve gpgme SMIME uid display: align each line by
	the length of the first.

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Show more information about problematic SMIME
	signatures under gpgme. Also warn if the key is not known to be
	good. For some reason expired keys in my environment are not
	flagged as expired in sig->status or sig->summary.

2008-06-28 20:33 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (1492c24f2a4e)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Extract CN from client certificate in gnutls.
	Nothing currently uses it, but I suspect we should be using it as
	the external auth name in mutt_sasl_client_new.

	* UPDATING, globals.h, init.h, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c:
	Basic support for $ssl_client_cert when compiled with
	gnutls. The key must not be encrypted. Closes #2911.

2008-06-27 12:04 -0700  Petr Písař  <petr.pisar@atlas.cz>  (40c6e851bf76)

	* po/cs.po: Updated Czech translation.

2008-06-26 12:52 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (c5256c65eedb)

	* handler.c: Mark new error message for translation.

	* curs_lib.c: Force a resize event after calling an external editor.
	Closes #2207

	* lib.c, lib.h, mh.c: fflush before fsync and close. Closes #2962
	again.

	* mh.c: fsync maildir/mh messages on commit. Closes #2962.

2008-06-25 23:40 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (32374c911c6c)

	* smime.c: Check S/MIME signing ID exists before attempting to use
	it. Closes #3069. Also make (s)ign automatically ask for a key if
	no default is defined.

	* init.h: Make $move default to no instead of ask-no. Closes #2945.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Document difference between index and pager
	search. Closes #2886.

	* commands.c, copy.c, crypt-gpgme.c, handler.c, mbox.c, pgp.c: Make
	mutt_copy_message distinguish between fatal and non-fatal errors.
	Non-fatal errors should prevent moving messages, since they indicate
	data loss. But mutt should still attempt to display them, since
	being able to see some attachments is better than nothing. Also stop
	printing out non-PGP material in application/pgp attachments. Closes
	#2545, #2912.

2008-06-24 23:12 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (f5fe657f0633)

	* handler.c: Make multipart decoding a little more
	forgiving. First, ignore bad content-transfer-encoding in
	multipart sections. Second, if an attachment fails to decode,
	print a warning and continue instead of giving up on the entire
	message.

1970-01-01 00:00 +0000  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (a2e8f6fab8d3)

	* doc/Muttrc.head: Make default muttrc header weeding
	tidier. Closes #286.

2008-05-23 01:40 -0400  Todd Zullinger  <tmz@pobox.com>  (73a180edce53)

	* pgp.c: Call mutt_need_hard_redraw() in pgp_decrypt_part().

	This change ensures that the screen is redrawn when using gpg-agent.
	Without this, mutt's navigation keybindings are lost after pinentry
	curses prompts for a passphrase to descrypt a message.

2008-05-28 22:16 -0700  Moritz Schulte  <moritz@g10code.com>  (7fd74c40eced)

2007-12-11 15:22 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (68a9c3e74f9a)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Update caching docs (hcache naming,
	maintenance)

	* pop.c: POP: Name hcache the way IMAP does. Place the file
	under $header_cache/<url>/mutt.hcache. For now ignore that this may
	break if hcache == bcache and a message's uid is "mutt.hcache"
	(extremely unlikely) in which case the user will loose only the
	hcache file.

	* pop.c: POP: Respect $message_cache_clean

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: mention $time_inc in tuning chapter

	* enter.c, history.h: Maintain different history lists for
	files and mailboxes. Closes #2999.

	* history.c: Do not trust history file and mutt code about history
	class. This prevents crashes as result of programming errors and/or
	wrong history file (e.g. negative or too high classes).

2007-12-08 12:54 -0800  Michael Elkins  <me@mutt.org>  (3971bcfd9112)

	* mh.c: Skip over messages which were previously parsed after sorting
	the tail of the list. Avoids a segmentation fault when rescanning
	the new/ subdir of a maildir when messages were left over from a
	previous scan.

2007-12-07 11:38 -0800  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (b891b1736885)

	* lib.c, md5.h: Check definition of ENOTSUP before use
	(closes #2983)

	* mh.c: Sort MH folders into natural order after 2nd pass (closes
	#463).

	* init.h: Mention subscribe and lists commands for
	$ignore_list_reply_to (closes #2996).

	* mx.c: Don't attempt to move messages when $mbox is unset.

2007-12-05 10:03 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (63c97881cb76)

	* UPDATING, configure.ac, main.c, mh.c: Improve inode sorting,
	enable it by default and add MH support. Sorting is done on-demand
	only before the first stat() or open()
	($maildir_header_cache_verify=yes/hcache miss). Furthermore, only
	a partial list of messages starting from that item is sorted
	reducing sorting overhead in most cases. For a fully hcache'd
	folder with $maildir_header_cache_verify=no, no sorting is needed
	and no sorting will be done. MH parsing is now two-pass, too to
	simplify the code and remove duplication.

2007-11-30 10:29 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (5c635c9b5982)

	* configure.ac: Add version numbers for bdb 4.6

	* parse.c, sendlib.c: RfC2047 decode/encode X-Label: header
	(Closes #2970).

	* commands.c: Format status line for external and internal pager the
	same way to make %P work

2007-11-29 16:03 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4899bcc1c2c3)

	* doc/db-cleanup.xsl: Add ascii-replacements for 0x2dc
	(tilde) and 0x2026 (...) too. The manual cannot be clean us-acii
	but now we should have at least latin1

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/db-cleanup.xsl: Add a really ugly hack to make
	sure the plain text manual is us-ascii. The hack is filtering
	manual.html to another HTML file but replacing unicode chars by
	their ascii equivalents. The intermediate file is used to dump HTML
	to us-ascii text (and only for that).

	* hcache.c: Fix hcache build issue when building with gdbm if qdbm
	is installed, too

2007-11-21 13:19 +0100  Miroslav Lichvar  <mlichvar@redhat.com>  (9286a76e79a2)

	* send.c: Don't ignore $from in batch send mode.

2007-11-23 15:11 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (12a1d843c975)

	* curs_lib.c: Don't attempt to print progress if inc is 0, just
	print initial message

2007-11-21 14:14 -0800  Ronny Haryanto  <ronnylist@haryan.to>  (0e99eaaecd67)

	* po/id.po: Updated Indonesian translation

2007-11-21 16:47 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (309ab3a63d91)

	* UPDATING: Add UPDATING entry for $check_mbox_size

	* init.h: Clarify the description for $timeout

	* UPDATING: Remove raw utf-8 char in UPDATING to make it ascii
	again

2007-11-20 19:46 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (96f931ae0b22)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Document that save-hook/fcc-hook/fcc-
	save-hook use $index_format expandos. Closes #2135.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, pattern.c: Simple search: Allow
	[~+%] to be \-escaped. Closes #2426.

	* configure.ac, strsep.c: Add glibc implementation of strsep() in case
	a system misses it. Closes #2989.

	* lib.h, mbyte.c: Alternate fix for not calling
	bind_textdomain_codeset() to fix Solaris build.

2007-11-19 15:32 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (033eba2d6834)

	* rfc3676.c: Make f=f handler multibyte-aware by not buffering flowed
	content until it's finished. We now write out content as we read it
	(which simplifies the code quite a bit) and properly flow multibyte
	paragraphs. This should improve DelSp=yes handling where a flowed
	paragraph may not have spaces at all except trailing ones for
	flowable paragraphs (after concatenating lines we didn't have access
	to the original break points any longer). We still split content by
	ASCII space (this should be safe as f=f itself uses ASCII space to
	mark flowable lines (even for languages that aren't expected to use
	spaces, see DelSp). Closes #862.

2007-11-15 13:17 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (a0161768f631)

	* doc/makedoc-defs.h, doc/makedoc.c: Fix more documentation build
	issues. Define USE_SASL (for $smtp_authenticators) in makedoc-
	defs.h, include it in makedoc.c to force doc rebuild if makedoc-
	defs.h changes.

	* parse.c, protos.h, send.c: Properly parse and validate Message-IDs
	from my_hdrs. Closes #2452.

	* configure.ac: Check for bind_textdomain_codeset() outside libc,
	too.

2007-11-15 11:53 +0100  peb  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>  (22c68faeec08)

	* lib.h: Don't use bind_textdomain_codeset() if we're not using
	NLS/gettext. Closes #2162.

2007-11-15 11:22 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (933e57dff004)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Properly document simple searches and its
	"secret" keywords. Closes #2136.

2007-11-13 13:31 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (7a4a154eefa5)

	* wcwidth.c: Fix compiler warnings in new wcwidth.c (too large values
	for 'unsigned short')

	* hg-commit: hg-commit: Run 'make validate' in doc/ if manual.xml
	is present

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Document that %f in $index_format is
	either Return-Path: or From: depending on which parses correctly.
	Also note that alternates' regex should be as precise as possible to
	avoid mismatches. Closes #1894.

	* init.h: Properly document $hostname, link it to $use_domain and
	$hidden_host. Closes #891.

2007-11-07 14:54 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (84284776659e)

	* Makefile.am, po/Makefile.in.in, po/POTFILES.in: Don't build
	keymap_alldefs.h in srcdir as it may be read-only

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Don't try to build $(PACKAGE).pot in srcdir as it
	may be read-only

2007-11-08 22:13 -0800  Michael Elkins  <me@mutt.org>  (4bba47e6d026)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Removed the [!] prefix from the usage from the
	usage string for the un/mailboxes command since it has no special
	meaning in this context other than referring to $spoolfile.

2007-11-08 11:48 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (daf29fe0ed4c)

	* UPDATING, curs_lib.c, globals.h, init.h: Add $time_inc to
	control progress update frequency. I found 250ms to be noticeably
	different from the old behaviour, and it ruins the rounding of the
	other _inc variables.

	* color.c, copy.c, imap/command.c: Turn down some debug logging
	levels

2007-11-08 09:03 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (92a6bfbed657)

	* doc/Makefile.am: Add stamp-doc-rc to makedoc-all to build Muttrc
	with fresh checkout

2007-11-07 14:48 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (b68ccc2e66e2)

	* curs_lib.c, mutt_curses.h: Suppress progress bar updates less than
	250ms apart. Closes #2899.

2007-11-07 12:12 -0800  Emanuele Giaquinta  <e.giaquinta@glauco.it>  (c62c5495d67c)

	* wcwidth.c: Updated wcwidth to Unicode 5.0

2007-11-07 12:03 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (fce40f3a1aec)

	* Makefile.am, Muttrc.head, doc/Makefile.am, doc/Muttrc.head, doc
	/makedoc-defs.h, doc/makedoc.c, functions.h, init.h, makedoc-defs.h,
	makedoc.c: Try to fix parallel build problems by moving makedoc to
	doc/. This also requires to move Muttrc into doc/.

2007-11-06 16:34 -0800  Emanuele Giaquinta  <e.giaquinta@glauco.it>  (ac14b76ef8b2)

	* Makefile.am: Remove unnecessary workaround for automake
	dist target

2007-11-06 18:23 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (1770ab532bfd)

	* curs_lib.c, imap/imap.c, imap/message.c, mbox.c, mh.c,
	mutt_curses.h, pattern.c, pop.c, pop_lib.c, smtp.c: Add
	percentages to progress bar optionally supplied by caller. This is
	necessary to let the mbox driver print useful percentages. If
	there's no percentage given and we have a size, calculate on it on
	our own.  Closes #2929.

	* mh.c: (Re-)Add total msg count to progress for parsing maildirs

2007-11-05 14:24 -0800  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (ecb694b6176b)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation

2007-11-05 17:47 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (6b9e91edba54)

	* curs_lib.c: Save value of errno across mutt_endwin()
	calls. Mutt_endwin() is sometimes called after noticing an error
	but before printing the message via perror(). Closes #2965.

2007-11-05 15:53 +0100  Emanuele Giaquinta  <e.giaquinta@glauco.it>  (b8dc6926ddf4)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fix typo

2007-11-05 14:53 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (ad7983699656)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Improve [un]mailboxes
	documentation. Closes #2204.

2007-11-05 12:11 +0100  Ralf Wildenhues  <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>  (645fcdd66828)

	* configure.ac, intl/Makefile.in, po/Makefile.in.in: Optionally define
	$datarootdir on our own for autoconf <2.60 compatibility. While I'm
	at it, fix two warnings in other files about ignoring datarootdir
	with autoconf >2.60. Closes #2905.

2007-11-04 13:19 -0800  Vsevolod Volkov  <vvv@mutt.org.ua>  (dc5ec6dbb278)

	* po/ru.po: Updated Russian translation

2007-11-04 13:17 -0800  Ivan Vilata i Balaguer  <ivan@selidor.net>  (1f72281eb36c)

	* po/ca.po: Updated Catalan translation

2007-11-04 13:16 -0800  Roland Rosenfeld  <roland@spinnaker.de>  (b2f0d89881dd)

	* po/de.po: Updated German translation

2007-11-04 19:10 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (02e8b9c7bdc6)

	* UPDATING: Fixup UPDATING for 1.5.16/1.5.17

2007-11-04 18:27 +0100  cypher  <cypher@conuropsis.org>  (ab676b9f0c04)

	* url.c: Use strtok_r() to parse mailto: links, not strtok(). In
	case a headers needs to call mutt_parse_references() which uses
	strtok(), too, later headers will be silently discarded.  Closes
	#2968.

2007-11-04 18:14 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (6248b3c04f61)

	* main.c, url.c: Prevent mailto parsing buffer overflow by ignoring
	too long header. If they're longer than our buffer, we can't turn it
	into a header to be parsed by mutt_parse_rfc822_line() anyway, so we
	bail out in this case. Also make main() catchup mailto parsing
	errors. Closes #2980.

	* UPDATING: Add 1.5.17 to UPDATING

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Improve DSN docs (require sendmail-
	compatible MTA, add SMTP notes). Closes #2979

2007-11-03 11:12 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (0c054faeb285)

	* muttlib.c: Check Maildir for not being NULL when expanding
	'='-paths. Closes #2977.

2007-11-02 16:55 -0700  Pawel Dziekonski  <dzieko@pwr.wroc.pl>  (cc5de08f4612)

	* po/pl.po: Updated Polish translation.

2007-11-01 20:36 -0700  Petr Pisar  <petr.pisar@atlas.cz>  (0b4bd0452b5a)

	* ChangeLog, po/cs.po: Updated Czech translation.

2007-11-01 15:45 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (5123cded9988)

	* configure.ac: Use $datarootdir as default prefix for documentation
	(closes #2905)

2007-11-01 14:07 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (cd03dff9b576)

2007-11-01 21:21 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4f3814a57eaf)

	* INSTALL, UPDATING, rfc822.c: Unbreak exact address feature. The
	problem was that when reading back tempfiles for pager display,
	trailing \n were not removed from the input so the pager displayed 2
	instead of 1.

2007-11-01 12:13 -0700  Oswald Buddenhagen  <ossi@kde.org>  (8aebd2ea4db8)

	* configure.ac: Detect BDB automatically if --with-bdb is empty

2007-11-01 14:33 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (80f1331abec2)

	* doc/devel-notes.txt: devel-notes.txt: Mention where hg repo is, how
	to clone and update

	* doc/TODO: Documentation: Add doc/TODO with some items still open

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: s/SMTP support/SMTP Support/ (for
	consitency)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Remove 404 link for fetchmail,
	mention getmail, too

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add short section on SSL/TLS support
	(needs more details)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Document URL syntax in just one place,
	let others refer to it.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Document optional SMTP support

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add some general notes about optional
	features. Mention 'configure --help' and 'mutt -v' output.

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Move POP3, IMAP and
	cache-related sections to their own chapter.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add ids to all tables and use <xref/>
	for reference.

2007-10-31 16:34 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (7cebeacc3b83)

	* config.guess, config.sub, depcomp, install-sh, missing: Remove
	autotools support files which autoreconf -i can generate

	* Makefile.am, cvslog2changelog.pl: cvslog2changelog.pl is obsolete

	* doc/muttbug.man: s/Mercurial/hg/

	* doc/muttbug.man: s/cvs/Mercurial/

2007-10-31 14:09 -0700  rea-mutt  <rea-mutt@codelabs.ru>  (c6ce36a67121)

	* lib.c: Fall back to rename for ENOTSUP and EOPNOTSUPP
	too. Closes #2975

2007-10-31 14:04 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (51595292e112)

	* imap/imap.c: Fix the test for flushing queued STATUS requests in
	imap_buffy_check. This should fix the bug that caused every other
	IMAP connection to fail to get the new message counts. Thanks to exg
	for his generous help debugging this one.

2007-10-25 17:03 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (5d96f24efa85)

	* muttlib.c, protos.h: Large file support for mutt_pretty_size().
	Based on a patch by Corinna Vinschen, adjusted for LOFF_T/OFF_T_FMT
	(closes #2191).

	* UPDATING: Add UPDATING entry for %P for $pager_format

2007-10-18 10:20 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4e738d998bb3)

	* hdrline.c: Enlarge temporary buffer in hdr_format_str to prevent
	subject truncation. The subject along with the thread tree are
	composed using a SHORT_STRING-sized buffer which may lead to
	truncation even though the destination buffer is large enough.

2007-10-16 11:33 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (c33f288c3aab)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: fix typo (closes #2971).

2007-10-15 11:01 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (35e5c34b7e91)

	* rfc3676.c: f=f: Print standalone fixed lines as-is (closes #2917).

2007-10-11 12:10 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (c15eeb44f139)

	* UPDATING, doc/manual.xml.head: Document format string
	pipes. This is roughly the commit message only. Add a line to
	UPDATING (mark it as a change rather than a new feature as it may
	break setups).

	* init.h: Document that $indent_string actually is a format string.

	* muttlib.c: Do not consider empty pipes for filtering in format
	strings. This fixes a crash with $indent_string="|" and
	$text_flowed unset.

2007-09-28 11:06 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (709db707bcdf)

	* curs_lib.c, muttlib.c, protos.h: Make mutt_FormatString()'s string
	truncation multibyte aware

2007-09-19 12:22 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (c768a1ebf78a)

	* menu.c: Enlarge buffers for printing menu entries from STRING to
	LONG_STRING. Now that multibyte padding works, we may too soon run
	into too short buffers for common terminal widths in graphical
	terminals.

	* compose.c: Use mutt_paddstr() to print compose menu's status line
	rather than printw(). All other menus use mutt_paddstr(): printw()
	prints only N bytes, not N columns.

2007-09-18 11:37 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (5827331565a2)

	* init.h: Document that $charset is a fallback for $send_charset

2007-09-17 17:32 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (ae47263fc1b0)

	* muttlib.c: Enable padding with multibyte chars for %>X, %*X and
	%|X

	* hcache.c, hcache.h, main.c: Include hcache backend version info
	in mutt -v output

	* init.c: Use NONULL to ensure we can pretty-print empty paths for
	option queries

2007-09-14 11:35 -0700  Emanuele  <Emanuele Giaquinta>  (c699e5847630)

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac: The new MD5 code needs AC_C_BIGENDIAN on
	big-endian systems

2007-09-13 09:39 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (154417d57b9d)

	* configure.ac: Do not clobber --with-bdb argument (closes #2955)

2007-09-11 18:33 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (785c95c8ff9a)

	* commands.c: Enlarge error buffer in mutt_enter_command() to not
	truncate option queries. The error buffer gets passed down into
	parse_set() using it to report option values. SHORT_STRING is too
	short to even print some defaults (e.g. $status_format).

	* muttlib.c: Let %*X padding share the same code of %>X padding The
	current implementation of %*X was completely multibyte-unaware and
	had buffer overflow issues with large terminals. Now we use the same
	code as %>X has and optionally only truncate left content to make
	sure the right content can be printed entirely.

2007-09-10 11:14 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (664c5ec1a727)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2007-09-10 08:54 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (49d69399cf21)

	* curs_lib.c, muttlib.c, protos.h: Make mutt_FormatString() more
	multibyte-aware As default cause, don't copy raw bytes but copy
	multibyte chars instead to ensure column computation is correct
	(needed for padding).

	* init.c: Escape option values for variable queries and completion
	to ensure they're parsable

2007-09-09 15:48 -0700  Andreas Jaggi  (4e9445a06369)

	* imap/imap.c: Let imap_complete_hosts work with the last mailbox
	(closes #2949). This was an off-by-one error in the mailbox loop.

2007-09-09 15:20 -0700  Julien Cristau  (7e60c2515318)

	* ChangeLog, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Only check whether GNUTLS error is
	fatal when an error occurs (closes #2954). The API for GNUTLS
	changed to require this in 1.7.18.

2007-09-08 15:30 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (1e4a6efddc81)

	* prepare: autoreconf --include doesn't pass its argument to aclocal.
	Let ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am handle that.

	* configure.ac: Attempt to clean up DB back-end selection

2007-09-06 20:13 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (648ad3832e82)

	* muttlib.c: Rewrite padding logic for mutt_FormatString()

	Do so by checking columns and bytes individually to make sure we
	really don't write past the end of allocated buffers. This patch
	fixes all my crashes I saw with files attached to/with the settings
	for #2882 and #2900.

2007-09-05 10:52 +0000  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (078744e84667)

	* init.c, pattern.c: Fix/improve intl error messages

	* browser.c: Interpret relative paths in browser relative to shown
	dir, not working dir (closes #2471).

	* help.c, pager.c, pager.h: Teach pager how to ignore $wrap and use it
	for help (closes #2896).

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: make sure <screen/> contents in shorter
	than 80 chars

	Otherwise conversion to plain text may cause line breaks rendering
	examples syntacially invalid (closes #2185).

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: don't use <screen/> to present
	structured data

	* muttlib.c: Fix buffer overflow in mutt_FormatString()

	The variable in question is supposed to track string sizes, not
	string widths (closes #2882 and #2900).

2007-09-04 17:22 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (7df563e4b7fd)

	* configure.ac: Add libz to crypto libs if available
	(closes #2303).

2007-09-04 12:06 -0700  Ivan Vilata i Balaguer  <ivan@selidor.net>  (d9a6b3f8a492)

	second.

2007-08-28 11:33 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (3f8829e739e9)

	* init.h: Insert .pp after .de to fix man page generation (closes
	#2940)

	* imap/imap.c: Check subscriptions after any authentication,
	rather than after fist connection (closes #2908)

	* dotlock.c, lib.h, mutt.h: Use limits.h for PATH_MAX instead of
	posix1_lim.h (closes #2525)

2007-08-27 11:07 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (9cfb5ac98e26)

	* imap/auth_cram.c: Update auth_cram for new MD5 code
	(untested).

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, hcache.c, md5.c, md5.h, md5c.c,
	pgppubring.c, pop_auth.c: Replace RFC md5 implementation with GPL
	version from coreutils

2007-08-16 09:32 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (d096219907e7)

	* curs_lib.c: Check for lost tty if getch returns error (closes #1220)
	Great thanks to Vincent Lefevre for tracking this one down.

2007-08-15 20:09 -0700  Michael Vrable  <mvrable@cs.ucsd.edu>  (acd71f2f2555)

	* rfc3676.c: Fix RFC 3676 (format=flowed text) handling.

	The old code would consider a line containing "> " to be flowed, but
	since this is a quoted and space-stuffed line containing no
	additional text, by my reading of RFC 3676 it should be fixed.

	Clean up the handling of format=flowed text. Fix the test to
	determine whether a line is fixed--if a line ends in a space only
	because the last character is a space from space-stuffing, consider
	the line to be a fixed line. This makes the test for ((buf_len -
	buf_off) <= 0) later no longer necessary.

	Also simplify the code by removing checks for curline being non-
	null; it is allocated at the start of the function and never
	reallocated to size zero, so it should never be a null pointer.

2007-08-08 10:49 -0700  Kyle Wheeler  (6d3e90261321)

	* makedoc.c: Trim whitespace in definition lists for man pages (closes

2007-08-02 22:30 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (aefdab8fad80)

	* init.h: Clarify the documentation for $use_envelope_from
	(closes #2936). Thanks to Vincent Lefevre for the suggestions.

2007-07-25 11:16 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (6bc60516fffa)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

	* init.c: Check that spam expression has enough matches for its
	template. Closes #2927.

2007-07-14 17:26 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (f4b2c6eba5fd)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: GPGME: do not attempt to extract signatures
	unless gpgme_op_verify returned success.

2007-07-09 11:32 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (4e8e3db418ea)

	* send.c: Allow send-hooks to effectively change $from and $use_from

	* mx.c: Clean up mx.c: init stat structs to zero

	prev_sb.st_size was initialized to zero if USE_FCNTL but not if
	USE_FLOCK. Silence the gcc warning for both cases by zeroing the
	stat structures on the stack.

	Other minor cleanups:
	- clean up some whitespace
	- convert return (foo) to return foo
	- return r at the bottom of the function instead of testing values and
	returning them explicitly
	- add vim modeline

2007-07-10 14:47 +0200  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (c06e39893cce)

	* handler.c: Actually bail out, but wiht an ok return value.

	* handler.c: Don't bail out on a bad message/external-body!

2007-07-08 18:27 -0700  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (6241f5669264)

	* commands.c, curs_lib.c, doc/manual.xml.head, init.h, lib.h, menu.c,
	muttlib.c, query.c, recvcmd.c: This patch implements the "%* "
	notation, which is analogous to "%> " but gives precedence to the
	right side instead of to the left when the fill length is zero. The
	default $pager_format is updated to use it so that %P is always
	available at the edge of the screen.

2007-07-08 15:34 -0700  Edmund GRIMLEY EVANS  <edmund820@rano.org>  (5d74a79deeb3)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix some compiler warnings in GPGME. Closes #2919.

	* crypt-gpgme.c: GPGME: Stop parsing message as soon as PGP header
	is found. Use file_to_data_object to build data for inline
	signature verification instead of doing it by hand. This fixes
	inline verification for me.

	TODO: crypt-gpgme helper functions seem to return lots of pointers
	off the stack in very dubious ways.

2007-06-27 10:38 -0700  Dan Fandrich  <dan@coneharvesters.com>  (3354ac2e79c7)

	* pager.c: Fix %P in pager status for off_t variability.

2007-06-05 13:12 -0700  pywatson  <pywatson@gmail.com>  (9e90789518ad)

	* sort.c: Make sort by "To" stable (closes #2515).  compare_to()
	calls mutt_get_name(), which may return a static pointer if it in
	turn calls mutt_addr_for_display(). If this static pointer is used
	for a and b, the result is bad. The fix is to make a copy of the
	first object.

2007-05-17 14:40 +0200  Christoph Berg  <cb@df7cb.de>  (edefe5e1f2b4)

	* smtp.c: Forget SMTP password if authentication fails.  Thanks to
	Gregory Shapiro for the initial patch (I've moved the reset from
	smtp_auth_sasl up to smtp_auth, and used the account API instead
	of twiddling account bits by hand). Closes #2872.

2007-05-15 21:05 +0200  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (33af2883d52b)

	continue.

	* contrib/smime.rc, smime.c: contrib/smime.rc:
	$smime_verify_opaque_command fallback to -noverify to get signed
	text despite a failed -verify (but send only this first failure
	notice to stderr). smime.c: fflush() before rewind(). Closes #2428.

	progress indicator and add %P format code to $pager_status which

	Append "%> -- (%P)" to $pager_status to emulate old behavior.

	Closes #2087.

	* VERSION, po/bg.po, po/ca.po, po/cs.po, po/da.po, po/de.po,
	po/el.po, po/eo.po, po/es.po, po/et.po, po/eu.po, po/fr.po,

	po/sk.po, po/sv.po, po/tr.po, po/uk.po, po/zh_CN.po, po/zh_TW.po:
	automatic post-release commit for mutt-1.5.15

	* build-release: More minor build tweaks

	* Makefile.am, build-release, mkchangelog.sh: Fix up release
	scripts for Hg

	* lib.c: safe_rename: fall back to rename on ENOSYS and EPERM as well
	as EXDEV. sshfs returns ENOSYS when attempting cross-directory
	links. vfat returns EPERM.

	* lib.c: Make safe_open with O_EXCL friendlier for NFS. Per #2707,
	when an open file is moved into a different directory over NFS, it
	may leave a .nfsXXX hardlink behind. This causes the rmdir in
	safe_open to fail, leaving tempdir droppings around. This patch
	works around the problem by closing the file after creating it and
	reopening it after rename.

	This prevents mutt from suddenly finding new mail when switching
	from unknown UIDVALIDITY to known.

2007-04-04 09:37 -0700  Fabian Groffen  <grobian@orakel.ods.org>  (330cb15403f0)

	segfault in the new mboxcache hcache lookup. idata may not have an

	instead. For harmony with the other hcache callers, make them all
	canonify the path the same way with imap_hcache_open.

	* imap/imap.c: Fix segfault in new mboxcache hcache check when
	create is 0

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c: Use RECENT for first mailbox
	check if header cache check fails

	mail count. This prevents mutt from announcing new mail in mailboxes
	that have unseen, but not new, messages, if those mailboxes are in
	the header cache.

2007-03-29 21:08 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (359d9fbb5fda)

	* bcache.c, bcache.h, imap/message.c: Make message cache write to
	temporary location until file is complete. Previously mutt trusted
	the cache file even when it was incomplete, causing permanently
	incorrect message display if the fetch was interrupted for some
	reason.

	sendmail="ssh host sendmail".

2007-03-21 10:08 -0700  Christoph Berg  <cb@df7cb.de>  (92a0a184005d)

	* configure.ac: configure.ac: Make SSL tests for OpenSSL and gnutls
	behave the same For both this now mentions SMTP as a possible SSL
	user and also turns the error for configuring with gnutls without
	POP/IMAP/SMTP into a warning as the OpenSSL part does.

2007-03-20 13:39 -0700  Miroslav Lichvar  <mlichvar@redhat.com>  (b0172175cc89)

	* UPDATING, buffy.c, buffy.h, commands.c, configure.ac, init.h,
	main.c, mutt.h, mx.c: Make BUFFY_SIZE a runtime switch
	($check_mbox_size)

2007-03-20 13:17 -0700  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (2fbc65f3feb6)

	terminals, SHORT_STRING (128 byte) may not be enough so use
	LONG_STRING (1k) as STRING (256 byte) may well be too short for
	wider terminals. Closes debian #4152777.

	* rfc3676.c: Make f=f handler behave like old f=f handler for quoted
	lines Now lines containing quote characters but no further content
	appear as quoted lines again for making replies. Also, the spaces
	between quotes and text are removed to make output look as it did
	for the old handler.

2007-03-19 08:12 -0700  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (5681216fa395)

	mutt_xtitle script

	* muttlib.c: Remove trailing newlines from fmtpipe return value.

2007-03-14 13:49 -0700  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (63ad6be01750)

	* mutt.h, muttlib.c: Allow format strings to be filtered. Any format
	string ending in | will be expanded and piped through the first word
	in the string. The string returned will be used for display. If the
	returned string ends in %, it will be passed through the formatter a
	second time. This allows the filter to generate a replacement format
	string including % expandos.

2007-03-14 13:26 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (e9203a364537)

	#2837)

2007-03-14 13:09 -0700  Christoph Berg  <cb@df7cb.de>  (cbacb14a837a)

	* doc/mutt.man, main.c: mutt.man and mutt -h updates

	Document mutt --, remove the reference to
	flea, and generally update the mutt.1 manpage.

	(I removed -d from the SYNOPSIS part since it wasn't entirely
	correct syntactically there and putting it elsewhere seems like
	unnecessary clutter.)

2007-03-14 12:58 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (f20641ecca59)

	* hcache.c: Always give realpath a shot at the hcache folder name.
	Remove other hacks.

2007-03-14 12:53 -0700  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (18cd9834050d)

	* hcache.c: hcache: prepend current dir to path for local folders If a
	folder is local (i.e. stat() succeeds), prepend the current working
	directory if necessary to always fully qualify the path. Otherwise
	we may end up using different cache files for the same folder when
	given relative paths. This closes #2845.

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/manual.xml.head: Make manual validate against
	DocBook 4.2 DTD for "book" This adds a 'validate' target to

	Running it revealed two validation errors which this patch fixes:

	1) We declare 'article' as the doctype but want to use 'book' 2)
	Within a lists's items, we didn't include our text in a paragraph

	po/el.po, po/eo.po, po/es.po, po/et.po, VERSION, po/bg.po:
	automatic post-release commit for mutt-1.5.13

2006-08-11 16:25:59  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am: Include reldate.h in make dist, so docs won't be
	needlessly rebuilt.

2006-08-11 10:54:24  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* contrib/sample.muttrc-tlr: Update example -- it's amazing how
	little I've actually changed over the past couple of years.

2006-08-11 09:32:29  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>  (roessler)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, mutt.h, pattern.c: Mutt-thread patch. Use
	~(PATTERN) to match any threads that contain messages that
	match PATTERN.

2006-08-11 09:08:20  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* init.h, mutt.h: Use #ifdef in some appropriate places.
	(Particularly relevant when building the documentation.)

2006-08-10 22:16:11  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c: Unbreak imap_check_subscribed after command
	data type change.

2006-08-10 21:47:44  Ralf Wildenhues  <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>  (brendan)

	* doc/PGP-Notes.txt, doc/devel-notes.txt, doc/manual.xml.head,
	doc/smime-notes.txt: Fix some typos; regularise spelling from
	UK to US forms.

2006-08-10 21:43:47  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am: Only touch reldate.h if it actually changes.
	It was getting annoying rebuilding the manual after every commit.

2006-08-10 21:25:18  Ralf Wildenhues  <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, doc/instdoc.sh.in: No need to set
	CPP, OPS manually in Makefile.am.  Include stdlib.h in autoconf
	tests that use exit.

2006-08-10 20:20:28  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap_private.h, imap/browse.c, imap/command.c,
	imap/imap.c: Add type field for IMAP command data structure,
	check it before use.

	* imap/command.c: Handle IMAP out-of-order tagged
	responses. Closes: #2365.

	* imap/command.c, imap/util.c: Handle literal mailbox names
	in LIST responses (for Notes).	We should really have an IMAP
	stream tokenizer.

	* imap/command.c: Notes sometimes sends EXISTS messages for the
	wrong mailbox.

	* imap/message.c: More out-of-order FETCH fixes. This time I wrote
	a replay tool acting as an IMAP server based on a .muttdebug0
	file, and mutt handled the out-of-order responses served by it.

	* imap/command.c, imap/message.c: More fixes for out-of-order
	FETCH responses.

2006-07-18 18:15:30  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/devel-notes.txt: Document which versions of autoconf and

2006-07-14 18:39:14  roessler  (roessler)

	* po/ja.po, po/ko.po, po/lt.po, po/nl.po, po/pl.po, po/pt_BR.po,
	po/ru.po, po/sk.po, po/sv.po, po/tr.po, po/uk.po, po/zh_CN.po,

	po/fr.po, po/ga.po, po/gl.po, po/hu.po, po/id.po, po/it.po:
	automatic post-release commit for mutt-1.5.12

2006-07-14 18:12:49  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* UPDATING: There's no point in giving a date for each
	incompatible change.

	* UPDATING: Fix UPDATING.

2006-07-14 00:20:05  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Improved history documentation (modified
	for clarity).

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Document $my_ variables and add a section
	about how to calculate the header cache file name for a given
	folder. Modified for clarity.

	* main.c, mutt_curses.h: Fix 2305.

2006-07-11 23:34:11  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (roessler)

	* mbyte.c, protos.h, rfc2047.c, rfc2231.c: Fix #2173.

2006-07-09 20:05:02  Kyle Wheeler  <kyle-mutt-dev@memoryhole.net>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c: Plug an mbox leak parsing the Postponed folder in
	imap_open_mailbox (slightly modified to prevent bad free calls).

2006-07-07 23:10:51  Johan Svedberg  <johan@svedberg.com>  (brendan)

	* po/sv.po: Update to the Swedish translation.

2006-07-07 18:44:34  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* imap/message.c: Fix a small memory leak in the gap between
	the last cached header and the first uncached. (I've plugged a
	couple of other leaks that happen under error conditions.)

2006-07-07 17:00:05  Kyle Wheeler  <kyle-mutt-dev@memoryhole.net>  (brendan)

	* doc/muttrc.man.head: Fix a small inconsistency documenting
	'reset all.'

2006-07-07 16:21:57  Pawel Dziekonski  <dzieko@pwr.wroc.pl>  (brendan)

	* po/pl.po: Update.

2006-07-06 18:18:31  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c: Fix a string leak parsing STATUS responses.

	* score.c: Fix a small memory leak when updating a score pattern.

2006-07-05 00:31:38  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Reset myvar for each token in parse_set, so that
	things like set my_var=val &my_var ?charset work again. Noted
	by Alain Bench.

	* doc/Makefile.in, init.c: Undo breakage I introduced in VL's
	doc reldate patch.

	* UPDATING, init.h: Remove $imap_cachedir synonym, and update
	some docs.

	* bcache.c: Rename mutt_bcache_path to bcache_path (it's static),
	simplify it a bit, and just strip '/' in the URL portion up
	to path instead of replacing them with '_', for prettier cache
	folder names.

2006-07-04 17:23:16  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* history.c: Adopt shell convention of omitting from the history
	commands prefixed with a space.

2006-07-04 17:11:04  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, doc/manual.xml.head, globals.h, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c, imap/util.c, init.h, mh.c,
	pop.c, pop.h, Makefile.am: pdmef.cache.24: Generalise IMAP body
	caching and add POP support.  $imap_cachedir is now a synonym
	for $message_cachedir, and should be dropped soon since it hasn't
	been in an official release.

2006-07-03 16:19:43  Michael Tatge  <Michael.Tatge@web.de>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Some commands used a dash in the
	documentation instead of an underscore. Closes: #2270.

2006-06-29 22:14:08  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* UPDATING: Fill in missing entries in UPDATING.

2006-06-25 20:10:24  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: Add release date to manual version
	information.

2006-06-19 18:14:03  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <tamo@momonga-linux.org>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c: Fix browse_get_namespace() which could overflow
	ns[LONG_STRING].  (Possible remote vulnerability)

2006-06-19 17:50:10  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* po/fr.po: Update to current CVS.

2006-06-13 22:26:18  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am: Run cut under the C locale when parsing ChangeLog
	for reldate.

2006-06-13 07:52:52  René Clerc  <rene@clerc.nl>  (roessler)

	* cryptglue.c: typo

2006-06-08 11:56:05  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* commands.c, curs_main.c, globals.h, muttlib.c, sendlib.c: Clean
	up ReleaseDate mess; include ReleaseDate in User-Agent header.

	* crypt.c: Fix #2272.

2006-06-06 23:58:10  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Remove variable aliases from the output of mutt -D
	(modified for dubious cosmetic reasons). Closes: #2265.

2006-05-26 16:51:48  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* configure.in: When flags are added to CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS in
	configure.in, this should be done with a consistent
	order. Otherwise, when several versions of a library are
	installed, this could lead to a mismatch between the header and
	the library.

2006-05-26 16:38:18  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c, imap/message.c, mutt_socket.c, mutt_socket.h,
	pop_lib.c: Add mutt_socket_write_n to write binary data. Use this
	function in imap_append_message. Closes: #2244.

2006-05-21 23:25:48  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* .cvsignore, reldate.h: reldate.h is a generated file now: remove
	reldate.h from version control, and add it to .cvsignore.

2006-05-19 20:38:05  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: Add intro.html to distributed HTML files
	(fallout from conversion from article to book).

	* UPDATING: Use +/-/! instead of N/D/M in UPDATING.
                                 
2006-05-19 18:30:10  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am, README, UPDATING: The UPDATING document is supposed
	(when complete) to provide quick pointers by date to changed
	features (new options/commands, new features, changed defaults,
	etc.)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Document speed impact of attachment
	counting. This adds a short paragraph to manual.xml and
	cross-links %X-expandos to it.

2006-05-18 18:35:10  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* hcache.c, hcache.h, imap/imap.c, imap/message.c, mh.c: Use
	header_cache_t* instead of void* for header cache.

	In hcache.c, the header_cache structure is defined to match the
	needs per DB backend used. Thus the interface uses void* abstract
	from it. This patch adds a 'header_cache' forward declaration to
	hcache.h so that we at least get a little more type safety.

	* INSTALL: Note that the DocBook 4.2 DTD should be installed
	locally in order to build the manual.

	* doc/chunk.xsl, doc/manual.xml.head, doc/manual.xml.tail,
	makedoc.c: Properly use tables in manual where appropriate.

	Now, lots of information which really deserves a table is just put
	into <screen/> sections with manual line breaks and things like
	that. This is ugly for several reasons including that the
	information stored there should be accessable straight from the
	table of contents. For the TOC, this patch switches to <book/> for the manual and uses a
        deeper split level so things actually look nicer. The only problem
	are tables which may be not so well supported when dumping the
	HTML to .txt but the DocBook->txt converter with table support is
	work-in-progress...

	* imap/message.c, imap/utf7.c, imap/util.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c,
	muttlib.c, mx.c, pager.c, pgplib.c, remailer.c, rfc1524.c,
	rfc2047.c, rfc2231.c, rfc822.c, sendlib.c, buffy.c, charset.c,
	check_sec.sh, color.c, enter.c, group.c, hash.c, init.c, lib.c,
	menu.c, mh.c, mutt_idna.c: Avoid safe_free() usage and add
	security checks.

	Add checks to check_sec.sh for memory functions. These include a
	check for use of safe_free() instead of FREE() and a check whether
	FREE(&...) is used. For the former, __SAFE_FREE_CHECKED__ is to be
	used, for the latter __FREE_CHECKED__ to avoid messages from
	check_sec.sh

2006-05-18 08:53:31  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (roessler)

	* Makefile.am, build-release, reldate.h: Autogenerate reldate.h
	from ChangeLog.

2006-05-17 18:37:33  Rene Clerc  <rene@clerc.nl>  (brendan)

	* po/nl.po: Updated nl.po.

2006-05-16 05:01:02  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* po/fr.po: Updated fr.po

2006-05-06 07:42:51  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (roessler)

	* mh.c: Header caching for mh folders.

2006-05-05 17:27:10  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Set system ID to docbook 4.2, in harmony
	with schema URL.

2006-05-02 22:23:35  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* muttlib.c: Fix an improper dereference in mutt_buffer_init (I think).

2006-04-28 19:52:45  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* mutt.h, parse.c, pattern.c, protos.h, hdrline.c: Cleaning
	up attachment counting.  This takes away some of the worst
	aberrations, but the feature is still a performance hog.

2006-04-28 12:19:20  Ralf Wildenhues  <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>  (roessler)

	* mutt_socket.h: "could somebody please move this really nasty
	bug fix taken from Brendan's esmtp patch to the mailine code?" --
	"done"

2006-04-28 08:35:03  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c, init.h, main.c, mutt.h, mutt_socket.c, mutt_ssl.c,
	mutt_ssl.h, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c, pop_lib.c, buffy.c, configure.in,
	globals.h, init.c: pdmef+fix+sslinterface. Triggered by a warning
	when compiling with POP and GNUTLS, I noticed the SSL interfaces
	for OpenSSL and GNUTLS internally are different which doesn't
	make sense.

	* configure.in, mh.c: pdmef+fix+dino.diff. This fixes mutt/2174.

2006-04-24 19:59:07  exg@gentoo.org  (brendan)

	* configure.in: Don't abort configure if --without-sasl is
	given without any network options. Gentoo's build scripts seem
	to generate this configuration.

2006-04-20 16:46:49  Moritz.Schulte@ruhr-uni-bochum.de  (roessler)

	* headers.c, mutt_crypt.h, postpone.c: Make mutt_parse_crypt_hdr
	more SMIME-aware.

2006-04-18 23:22:30  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/auth_sasl.c: Handle Exchange's bogus short challenge in
	AUTH NTLM (problem debugged by Alexander Gattin).

2006-04-18 15:28:50  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* recvattach.c: Fix saving of attachments.

2006-04-05 17:28:30  Phil Pennock  <mutt-dev@spodhuis.demon.nl>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c:	(1) OP_MAIN_LINK_THREADS needs to check for
	IMAP_ACL_DELETE permission, since the thread linking involves
	deleting the old email. (2) makes CHECK_IMAP_ACL() a no-op if
	USE_IMAP is not defined; then cleans up a bunch of the #ifdef
	litter.

	* imap/command.c: Don't pass a null destination to imap_fix_path
	in the default STATUS handler when the mailbox name is implicitly
	INBOX. Thanks to Kai Hendry for the test mailbox and Sami Liedes
	for the backtrace. Closes debian #351337.

	* init.h: Set $record default to ~/sent (closes: #2068).

2006-03-30 19:50:01  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Tighten up lists/subscribe example,
	to close #2198.

2006-03-28 18:04:21  Mike Hallock  <mhallock@scs.uiuc.edu>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c: imap-fetch-mail should check that there is a
	Context before dereferencing Context->magic to avoid a segfault
	possibility.

2006-03-28 01:08:28  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>  (brendan)

	* recvattach.c: Sanitize attachment file names (seatbelt for
	inattentive recipients).

2006-03-24 23:15:37  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>  (brendan)

	* INSTALL: Document the need for a docbook-xsl bundle in order
	to build the docs.

2006-03-15 12:26:00  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/message.c: Don't store UIDNEXT unless we know it.

	* imap/message.c: Only synthesize UIDNEXT if we've fetched
	uncached messages. Fixes a FETCH 1:0 bug Bruno Postle reported and
	helped to debug.

2006-03-13 23:21:51  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/message.c: Courier fails to send UIDNEXT on SELECT
	(a violation of RFC 3501 section 6.3.1) - synthesize it if it
	is missing.

	* init.h: Make imap_idle default to false for 1.5.12.

2006-03-03 10:12:27  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* hook.c: reply-hook is used in contexts where we don't have
	a Context structure available. Hence, it must not require the
	full message.

2006-03-03 09:55:46  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* query.c: Fix mutt/2189; lack of error checking in the query
	code.

2006-02-21 21:52:17  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* muttlib.c: Preallocate some buffer space before attempting
	vsnprintf in mutt_buffer_printf (Solaris 9 workaround).

2006-02-21 08:10:15  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* attach.c: Fix mutt/2186.

2006-02-21 00:29:10  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c, muttlib.c: Catch mutt_buffer_printf failures.

2006-01-26 07:13:06  Ralf Wildenhues  <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>  (brendan)

	* contrib/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in: Set datarootdir.

2006-01-20 21:21:31  Phil Pennock  <mutt-dev@spodhuis.demon.nl>  (brendan)

	* imap/message.c: Correct a fairly harmless typo parsing message
	\Recent flags.

2006-01-15 21:37:03  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, main.c,
	pattern.c: A conservative update of copyright years. Some other
	files may need updating too.

2006-01-14 01:16:59  Phil Pennock  <mutt-dev@spodhuis.demon.nl>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Tab-completion for my_ variable names and values.

2006-01-13 09:08:11  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* init.c: More compact code for managing the "my" variables list.

2006-01-12 19:09:28  Phil Pennock  <mutt-dev@spodhuis.demon.nl>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Update MyVars to the next entry when deleting the head
	of the list, instead of leaving it pointing to a freed entry.

2006-01-12 09:36:46  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (roessler)

	* po/fr.po: update

2006-01-12 06:07:50  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Teach mutt to expand mutt variables as it does
	environment variables. For example, you might put something like
	this into a hook: set sendmail="mysmtp -f $from". Allow
	user-definable variables starting with my_. Environment variables
	take precedence, and expansion does not occur in shell-escape.

2006-01-11 06:45:23  Recai Oktas  <roktas@omu.edu.tr>  (brendan)

	* po/tr.po: A tr.po update.

2006-01-10 21:06:22  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c: Sanity-check folder inferiors response. Brian
	Weaver reports that it fixes the extra delimiters bug triggered by
	dbmail's incorrect LIST response.

	* hdrline.c: Don't use uninitialised flags variable when fetching
	attachment count.  Closes: #2153.

2006-01-09 19:43:59  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c, mutt.h, pattern.c, protos.h, send.c, Makefile.am,
	globals.h, group.c, init.c, init.h: Adding pattern group support;
	see http://does-not-exist.org/mail-archives/mutt-dev/msg05693.html
	for instructions.  The ungroup command is not yet implemented,
	and documentation is lacking.

2006-01-04 17:28:32  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c: Zero out IMAP_LIST before each imap_cmd_step in
	browser to avoid bogus matches when the untagged response isn't a
	LIST response. Phil Pennock diagnosed and proposed a patch for
	this bug.

2006-01-03 17:35:18  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c: Pipeline CLOSE (it's always followed by a SELECT or
	a LOGOUT).

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c: If there is an * OK
	[CAPABILITY... qualifier on connect, parse it and skip the manual
	capability check.

	* imap/imap.h, imap/imap.c, postpone.c: Pipeline postponed mail
	check on mailbox open if appropriate.

2005-12-30 17:34:52  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c: Sort mailbox in SORT_ORDER in imap_sync_mailbox so
	that sync_helper doesn't end up resorting it 10 times.

	* imap/imap.c: Only resort headers in imap_make_msg_set if order
	!= SORT_ORDER. Fix sync_helper to return 1 in case of +FLAGS but
	not -FLAGS.

2005-12-26 23:55:19  Nik A. Melchior  <nam1@cec.wustl.edu>  (brendan)

	* doc/muttrc.man.head: Fix whitespace around ~X in
	muttrc.man.head.

2005-12-23 18:20:02  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c: Don't evaluate hcache
	unless uidnext > 0. This shouldn't happen, but it was reported
	to. I probably have to be a lot more careful about the uid
	datatypes but I'm too lazy to clean up right now.

	* imap/imap.c: Always use NOOP when imap_check_mailbox is called
	with force set. Seems to resolve a Cyrus idiosyncracy noted by
	Phil Pennock.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/message.c: IMAP message cache fixes: embed
	UIDVALIDITY in the cache file name, only delete deleted messages
	at sync time. Also use an alias to make the sync code clearer.

2005-12-22 20:14:04  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c: Fix at least Kyle Wheeler's new mail detection
	problems: call imap_fix_path on buffy path.

	* regex.c: Kyle Wheeler noticed a couple of warnings in the
	moribund regex code. One still remains that I'm too lazy to fix
	right now.

	* imap/message.c: Add <errno.h> for msg_cache_put.

	* globals.h, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c,
	imap/message.h, init.h: Add $imap_cachedir option. If set, mutt
	will keep copies of IMAP messages under this directory.

	* imap/imap.c: Check all connections instead of just the first
	when NONEW is set in imap_conn_find. Wait for root delimiter check
	to complete before SELECTing since we may need it to form the
	mailbox name.

	* imap/command.c: More logging in STATUS parser to track down new
	mail detection problems.

2005-12-21 21:02:50  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* hcache.c: Check for NULL data in refactored mutt_hcache_fetch.

	* hcache.c: Unbreak QDBM too.

	* hcache.c, hcache.h: I broke DB4 while refactoring hcache.c.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c: Cache
	UIDVALIDITY/UIDNEXT as header cache metadata, only attempt to
	fetch up to UIDNEXT from the header cache. Also a cosmetic
	correction: Display the actual first message being fetched (after
	hcache) instead of 1.

	* imap/command.c: Don't run pending IMAP commands until the
	current queue has drained. Many thanks to Vincent Lefevre for his
	patient help debugging.

	* imap/command.c: Compare full mailbox names when doing IMAP buffy
	check, not up to the length of the STATUS response.

2005-12-20 17:50:47  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* hcache.c, hcache.h, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/message.c, mh.c, protos.h, Makefile.am: Refactor header cache
	a bit to provide (fetch|store)_raw functions. These will let me
	keep folder metadata (UIDVALIDITY, NEXT, msg count etc) in the
	cache, which will help to sync more quickly.

	* imap/imap.c: Remove deleted entries from header cache on CLOSE.

2005-12-19 18:13:28  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.old: ChangeLog.old was just old ChangeLog
	entries with different formatting - I think it's time to put it
	out to pasture. I've moved all pre-1.4 entries from ChangeLog into
	ChangeLog.old now. This should have the nice side-effect of making
	the git mirror grow a little more slowly.

	* imap/imap.c: Catch another possible race when starting IDLE.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c: More IMAP
	header cache cleanup: remove expunged entries from cache, and
	don't bother checking the cache for mail that's arrived since the
	mailbox was opened. TODO: cache UIDNEXT, only check the cache for
	messages up to cached value.

	* imap/imap.c: Avoid a possible race when entering the IDLE
	command - if new mail notification is received before the +
	response, mutt may attempt to send a fetch command before it
	realises it's idling.

	* imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c, imap/imap.c: Much faster
	IMAP sync code, pipelined and everything. Now batch updates
	changed flags, instead of syncing each changed message
	individually.

	* imap/imap.c: Manually unidle at logout if necessary. Somewhat
	unclean - might be good to have an imap_unidle function...

	* imap/imap.c, imap/message.c, imap/message.h: Cache server-side
	flags, don't send flag updates if mutt's are the same. This can
	happen if a flag is toggled and toggled back, or we receive server
	updates, and the cache will make much faster sync possible later.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c: Pipeline MYRIGHTS, subscribed
	mailbox check and root delimiter check.

	* imap/imap.c: Clear name field from status callback before each
	IMAP completion attempt.

	* imap/message.c: Remove some cut-n-paste garbage from IMAP header
	cache code.

	* mx.c: Only mark unread messages as old when closing mailbox.

	* imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/browse.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c, imap/util.c, mx.c: Real
	support for the Old flag on IMAP.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h: Display success message when
	subscription command succeeds.

	* imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h:
	Replace imap_parse_list_response with a proper untagged response
	handler.

2005-12-16 18:49:40  Recai Oktas  <roktas@omu.edu.tr>  (brendan)

	* color.c, crypt.c, handler.c, init.c, parse.c, smime.c: Use
	ascii_str* instead of mutt_str* in several places where it's
	needed.

2005-12-16 18:18:52  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/message.c, imap/util.c: New new mail detection code. Now we
	use UIDVALIDITY/UIDNEXT to detect whether a mailbox has been
	changed since we last saw it, rather than the more ephemeral
	RECENT flag. We also keep a cache of mailboxes we've visited or
	called STATUS on, which might eventually make for better
	information in the browser and mailbox views. Big changes,
	probably not stable. IWFM.

2005-12-15 18:59:59  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/message.c: Whitespace shuffling.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c:
	Use mutt_buffer_printf in several places instead of a homebrew
	version.

	* configure.in, m4/funcs.m4, muttlib.c, protos.h: Add
	mutt_buffer_printf function, with autoconf test for va_copy.

	* imap/imap.c: IMAP keepalive might have been interacting badly
	with $timeout when IDLE was enabled. Use force option for IDLE too.

2005-12-14 17:29:57  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap_private.h: SASL-IR
	support for IMAP. The RTT was has begun. I had forgotten how
	strangely convoluted auth_sasl has become though...

2005-12-13 23:37:42  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mutt_ssl.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Add conn_poll (using
	raw_socket_poll) to SSL socket setup functions.

	* buffy.c: Fix recently-broken buffy notification for IMAP.

	* imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap.h, postpone.c: Restore IMAP postponed check in the wake
	of the buffy pipelining patch. Fall back to NOOP if IDLE poll
	fails. Allow for untagged messages when starting IDLE. Free
	idata->cmdbuf in imap_free_idata.

	* imap/TODO, imap/BUGS: Updated todo/bug list for IMAP

2005-12-12 17:24:12  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, init.h, mutt.h: Add $imap_idle
	boolean to disable the IDLE extension (may be needed with some
	servers like the particular version of dovecot I tried
	yesterday). Don't attempt to poll mailboxes with connections that
	haven't yet authenticated. Recognize NO responses again (silly
	typo, spotted by Charlie Allom)

2005-12-12 02:24:43  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	mutt_socket.c, mutt_socket.h, mutt_tunnel.c: IMAP IDLE support.

	* buffy.c: Whoops, don't break buffy for non-IMAP mailboxes!

	* buffy.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h,
	imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c: IMAP command batching code, used
	to pipeline mailbox poll requests. Up to 10 poll commands will be
	sent at a time (tunable in imap_private.h). This is a huge win on
	my currently awful wireless link. It takes a knife to a lot of
	fundamental IMAP code (mostly for the better), so it may have
	destabilised things. Time for some brave (or lazy
	non-Changelog-reading) testers to report... next up, IDLE
	support.
                                 
2005-12-10 07:06:44  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/util.c: Set up a command pipeline. Currently everything still
	runs a single command from start to finish before moving on, but
	this creates the infrastructure to pipeline mailbox polling
	calls. Bitter experience at the end of a flaky wireless link
	teaches me that this can be useful.

	* imap/auth_anon.c, imap/auth_cram.c, imap/auth_gss.c,
	imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c, imap/util.c: Move IMAP
	response buffer out of command into IMAP_DATA. Ironically this is
	to prepare for pipelined commands.

2005-11-24 12:50:27  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* curs_main.c, pattern.c: mutt/2142 suggests that the change
	from pattern.c,3.14 -> 3.15 causes inconsistency and confusion.
	Reverting the change; adding a helpful message to the status line.

2005-11-22 12:31:58  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* pgp.c: Fix "mixed messages" about the success (or not) of
	decrypting PGP messages.

	* handler.c: Actually, the previous fix for 2139 had a flaw.

	* handler.c: Fix mutt/2139; also Debian #340116.

2005-11-17 18:40:50  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* menu.c: a not entirely sane state of code.

	* menu.c: Another stab at #2019.

2005-11-01 08:42:00  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* menu.c: This should be a better patch for the menu break
	dance. (#2019)

2005-10-31 11:56:58  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>  (roessler)

	* imap/message.c: Fix 2119.

2005-10-31 10:51:54  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* mutt_idna.c: Fix the underlying problem behind mutt/2107.

	* menu.c: Fixing #2019.

	* flags.c: Fix #2123.

2005-10-21 04:35:38  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* smime.c, attach.c, buffy.c, copy.c, copy.h, crypt-gpgme.c,
	crypt.c, edit.c, handler.c, mbox.c, mutt.h, pager.c, parse.c,
	pattern.c, pgp.c, pgpmicalg.c, pgppacket.c, pgppubring.c, pop.c,
	postpone.c, protos.h, sendlib.c: Full large file support. Keep a
	close watch on your mailboxes everyone!

2005-10-18 07:04:50  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (roessler)

	* po/fr.po: update

2005-10-17 09:14:58  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (roessler)

	* smime.c: Fix S/MIME algorithm choice.

2005-10-14 09:30:11  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c: Fix imap/2112.

2005-10-10 18:26:31  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* pgp.c: Make PGP decode failure non-fatal when displaying
	messages (as opposed to decode-saving them). I think it would be
	nicer to include the original text when decryption fails
	though...

	* imap/command.c, setenv.c: Accept + as IMAP continuation, not
	just + . May close #2106. Feed check_sec candy in setenv.c.

2005-10-09 20:53:21  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* configure.in: Now that we always check for ncurses/ncurses.h,
	remove /usr special case.

	* configure.in, mutt_curses.h: Tweak ncurses autoconflation to
	check for ncurses/ncurses.h everywhere, not just in /usr. With
	--with-curses=/usr/local, should Close: #2095.

	* configure.in, setenv.c: Add Russ Allbery's setenv replacement
	function.

	* init.h: Correct doc nit for $meta_key, noted by Mark
	Weyer. Closes: #2105.

2005-10-06 06:15:00  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* browser.c: Sort browser entries after every IMAP browsing
	operation instead of just when explicitly requested. Closes:
	#2089.

2005-10-06 05:13:55  Jeff Ito  <jeffi@rcn.com>  (brendan)

	* smime.c: Add AES ciphers to S/MIME encryption options. Closes:
	#2103.

2005-10-05 19:24:40  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.c: Fix 'unattachments'. Closes: #2102.

2005-10-05 19:20:22  Jeff Ito  <jeffi@rcn.com>  (brendan)

	* smime.c: S/MIME key selection truncates the last character of
	the selected key for no apparent reason. Removed until someone
	can justify it. Closes: #2081.

2005-10-04 19:00:05  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* init.h: Tweak description of pop_checkinterval slightly. Closes:
	#2074.

	* hcache.c: Bump hcache Id for attachment counting patch.

2005-10-04 06:05:39  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (brendan)

	* Muttrc.head.in, doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head,
	globals.h, hdrline.c, init.c, init.h, mime.h, mutt.h, parse.c,
	pattern.c, protos.h, recvattach.c: Attachment counting for index
	display (patch-1.5.11.dgc.attach.6). Modifications: attach_recurse
	and attach_ignore_fundamental stripped, some debugging code
	removed, some bones thrown to check_sec.sh.

2005-10-04 05:24:00  Sébastien Hinderer  <Sebastien.Hinderer@libertysurf.fr>  (brendan)

	* pager.c: The following patch has an effect only when the
	braille_friendly variable is set. When this is the case, the
	cursor is put on the first line of the message body, when viewing
	it with the pager.

2005-10-04 04:29:09  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c: Piping and printing in IMAP folder index with
	imap_peek=no marks message read immediately.

2005-10-03 07:52:00  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (roessler)

	* curs_lib.c, send.c: fix a problem that appears with signatures
	without newline.

2005-09-30 18:24:17  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/devel-notes.txt: Change manual.sgml to manual.xml (noted
	by Alain Bench).

2005-09-30 01:42:50  Roland Rosenfeld  <roland@spinnaker.de>  (brendan)

	* po/de.po: Update.

2005-09-29 23:57:07  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* po/fr.po: Update.

2005-09-29 23:52:16  pi  <pi@beobide.net>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, po/eu.po: Basque translation.

2005-09-29 23:02:49  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, copy.c, sendlib.c: Ensure that Content-Length
	printf format specifier matches off_t size, to avoid mail-losing
	Content-Length: 0 (bug introduced by large file patch a couple
	of days ago). Closes: #2096.

2005-09-27 03:43:24  Johan Svedberg  <johan@svedberg.com>  (brendan)

	* po/sv.po: Update.

2005-09-24 20:03:04  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* edit.c: Inflict more needless pain on translators by splitting
	EditorHelp to satisfy -pedantic.

	* mbox.c, mutt.h, configure.in: Use fseeko/ftello when available
	while opening mbox/mmdf. Closes: #2084.

2005-09-24 19:36:35  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* copy.c, mutt.h, parse.c, sendlib.c, thread.c: Cosmetic fixes to
	MIME headers. Closes: #2086.

2005-09-24 17:51:17  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* po/ja.po: Update to HEAD.

2005-09-23 18:38:36  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* configure.in: Quote an error message.

2005-09-22 16:38:08  Takahashi Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, globals.h, hcache.c, init.h: Update QDBM patch to
	the current state of the art. Closes: #2003 (again).

2005-09-22 09:06:13  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* send.c: When composing a reply, there might be degenerate cases
	in which a CC header is created, but no To header.  In this case,
	we now use the auto-generated CC header as the To header.

2005-09-22 04:05:49  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Refactor mutt var completion so it can be used for
	inline expansions (eg $from). Actual expansion not committed yet.

	* send.c: If ContentType is null, assume text/plain. Stopgap; a
	better mechanism would sanity-check MuttVars assignments before
	allowing them. Closes: #2080.

	* imap/util.c, imap/imap.c: Don't allow imap URLs with empty
	hosts. Also don't attempt to complete on open connections when
	there aren't any (diagnosed by Nico Golde). Closes: #2079.

	* pattern.c: Use ctx instead of Context when checking whether or
	not to do IMAP search. Resolves a possible segfault in color index
	~b operations. I can't remember whether Context vs ctx was
	intentional - I doubt it.

2005-09-21 14:17:14  Adeodato Simo  <asp16@alu.ua.es>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c: Check for sigwinch in index before calling
	km_dokey, since for unknown reasons km_dokey seems to eat the
	signal in some cases. [Not reproducible in my ncurses environments
	- Brendan]. Closes: #1907.

2005-09-21 13:23:43  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c, pattern.c: Catch empty substring/regexp search
	arguments (precludes a segfault from dereferencing a null string
	pointer later).

2005-09-21 06:04:37  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>  (roessler)

	* init.h, mutt.h, configure.in, hcache.c: QDBM support for the
	header cache.

2005-09-21 04:50:31  Adeodato Simo  <asp16@alu.ua.es>  (brendan)

	* pgp.c: When using GPG agent in classic mode, set GPG_TTY if it
	isn't already set instead of bailing out. Closes: #2072.

2005-09-21 03:48:38  Takahashi Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Ensure that set doesn't change variables from within the
	help screen. I think this is a gross approach, and probably
	overkill, but it's the fault of the original code design, not
	Tamo's patch. Until a better way falls from the sky, this Closes:
	#2011.

2005-09-21 02:58:07  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c: Cancelling <change-folder> from within the pager
	will now keep you in the pager rather than kicking you back to the
	index. Closes: #2075.

2005-09-20 23:41:21  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* muttlib.c: Slight improvement on dgc's warning fix in edge cases.

2005-09-20 06:43:39  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Fix a null-pointer-dereference parsing aliases with
	-d3+.

	* muttlib.c: Clear a compiler warning.

2005-09-20 03:56:25  Gero Treuner  <gerotick@faveve.uni-stuttgart.de>  (brendan)

	* contrib/gpg.rc, doc/manual.xml.tail: Update locations of
	gpg-2comp, Gero Treuner.

2005-09-19 06:14:27  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mkchangelog.sh: I just realised what's been happening to the
	changelog: I recently got a new version of 'head' that refuses
	to accept -1 instead of -n 1, but doesn't actually return
	failure. So mkchangelog was feeding nothing to the cvs date
	argument, and instead merrily snarfing down the entire changelog
	every time. I've put in a simple $date != "" check. Thanks,
	textutils!  Thanks for ushering in the future! I'd like to shake
	your hand. Hard.

2005-09-19 05:12:29  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Remove mention of obsolete
	--enable-imap-edit-threads configure option.

2005-09-18 17:49:33  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* ChangeLog: Somehow the changelog got mangled (multiple copies
	of large parts).

2005-09-18 08:22:49  Vsevolod Volkov  <vvv@mutt.org.ua>  (roessler)

	* po/ru.po: update

2005-09-18 02:53:18  brendan  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: More cleanups, slightly better dependencies.

2005-09-18 02:35:10  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: Stupid hack to synchronise on makedoc for
	parallel builds. Only works when entered via make all. make
	stamp-doc-xml directly can fail in pathological conditions.

	* doc/Makefile.in: Attempt to work around make -j2
	breakage. Dependencies are still wrong, but I don't have
	the brainpower right now to get it right. People talk about
	imperative, functional, and logic programming, but no one ever
	mentions make programming.

2005-09-17 17:39:18  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* Muttrc.head.in: Clean up some Muttrc macros, and add macro
	'y' to jump to the mailboxes view. Closes: #2069.

2005-09-17 17:27:54  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* main.c: Some minor cleanups: tell users to go to bugs.mutt.org
	instead of using flea; update copyright year in mutt -v;
	reorganise USE opts a little; break long strings so that -pedantic
	stops complaining. Not sure that last one is worth the trouble
	it causes the po team...

2005-09-17 01:07:54  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* po/fr.po: Update.

2005-09-16 23:09:12  Kevin Scannell  <scannell@slu.edu>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, po/ga.po: Irish translation.

2005-09-16 15:20:59  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* build-release, po/Makefile.in.in: Move update-po out of make
	dist, into build-release. It seems to me that make dist should do
	as little as possible beyond putting the right files in a tarball.

2005-09-16 13:43:58  Ronny Haryanto  <ronnylist@haryan.to>  (roessler)

2005-09-16 02:15:45  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: Add stamp-doc-xml to "all".

	* doc/Makefile.in: stamp-doc-man is pointless as far as I can
	tell. Removed.

	* doc/Makefile.in: Tweak makefile so that the dist tarball
	doesn't always try to build docs.

	* configure.in: VERSION should go into CONFIG_STATUS_DEPENDENCIES,
	not CONFIGURE_DEPENDENCIES. Slap ma fro.

2005-09-15 23:18:48  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am, build-release: Move changelog target to
	update-changelog so that dist won't automatically invoke it,
	and have commit and build-release call it.

	* build-release: Now that 1.5.11 is out, previous versions won't
	be x.y.zi: adjust diff.

	* init.h: Refer to $use_envelope_from rather than old
	$envelope_from in description of $envelope_from_address.

2005-09-14 02:45:44  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* globals.h, init.h, sendlib.c: Add new $envelope_from_address
	variable for manually specifying the envelope sender. Rename (with
	compatibility synonym) $envelope_from to $use_envelope_from. Make
	$envelope_from subordinate to $use_e_f, as $from is to
	$use_from. From a discussion with TLR.

2005-09-13 20:36:17  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: Put chunked HTML manual in top doc directory
	instead of HTML subdirectory.  Solves a weird $distdir
	absolute/relative path nuisance.

2005-09-12 06:22:21  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* curs_lib.c, pop.c, pop.h, pop_lib.c: Teach pop driver about
	mutt_progress_bar. Allow progress bar to omit total size if zero
	(=unknown).

2005-09-10 18:47:17  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu	<ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>

2005-09-10 06:02:04  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c, curs_lib.c: A pair of small optimisations to the
	progress bar.

2005-09-08 16:37:59  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* pager.c: Revert bogus change to last message detection in
	mutt_pager.

	* pager.c: Forget line number when resolving in pager. This
	is beginning to get messy - maybe it would be better to only
	remember on specific operations like sync.

	* mutt_socket.c: Set CLOEXEC on sockets in IPv4 code path like
	we do in IPv6.

	* pattern.c: Make stringmatch pattern detection stateless.

	* curs_lib.c: ifdef USE_SOCKET around mutt_progress_bar.

2005-09-07 08:01:59  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* curs_lib.c, globals.h, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/message.c, init.h, mutt_curses.h: Display progress meter

	* pager.c: Adjust gross hack to return to the same line in the
	pager after an index operation so that it doesn't shoot past the
	end of the file if there are fewer lines on return (eg when weed
	is set).

	* mx.c, pgp.c: Silence some GCC warnings about uninitialized
	variables.

	* build-release, configure.in, mutt.h: Remove international
	vs. U.S. distribution distinction. build-release expects the
	previous version to be x.y.zi and should be updated again
	for 1.5.12.

2005-09-06 16:46:44  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: More documentation cosmetics (newlines
	between Usage: lines).

	* pager.c: Gross hack to return to the same line in the pager
	after executing an index function. Closes: #1210.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h,
	init.c, mutt.h, pattern.c: Extend pattern language to do simple
	string matches as well as regular expressions when the pattern
	is invoked with = instead of ~. And, when possible, perform
	full body searches on the IMAP server instead of locally, for
	an enormous speed boost.

	* imap/utf7.c, init.c, main.c, protos.h: Fix a memory leak in
	imap_utf7_decode and do a little cleanup on shutdown.  Get a
	high five from valgrind.

	* curs_main.c, main.c: Move SASL and IMAP shutdown hooks into
	main where they belong.

	* init.c: Release pwent after extracting data from it.

	breaks).

2005-09-04 20:10:25  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* init.h: Point $hide_top_limited to $hide_limited instead of
	$hide_missing. Likewise for $hide_top_missing. Closes: #2039.

	* init.h: Mention $sort_re in $strict_threads
	documentation. Closes: #2052.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Add a push example. Closes: #1591.

2005-09-04 06:57:04  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, doc/manual.xml.tail: Note that <Tab>
	is bound to next-new-then-unread by default, rather than
	next-new. Closes: #1637.

	* curs_main.c, pattern.c: Allow empty limits, and limits in
	empty mailboxes. Closes: #1853, #1906.

2005-09-03 23:22:31  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* send.c, attach.c: Note when mutt_edit_attachment fails and
	display error instead of prompting to abort an unmodified
	file. Closes: #2051.

2005-09-03 19:41:53  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* contrib/gpg.rc: One should let GnuPG charset be automatically
	infered from whatever current locale, without hardcoding.

2005-09-03 04:34:25  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Just use EXPR as a place holder for regular
	expressions, instead of any of EXPR, USER, ID and SUBJECT. Noted
	by Vincent Lefevre.

2005-09-02 18:50:34  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/manual.sgml.tail, doc/manual.xml.head,

	to manual.xml.*.

2005-09-02 18:18:19  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* keymap.c: Allow non-ascii characters in push arguments. Closes:
	#2023.

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head, mutt.h, pattern.c:
	Adjust ~l to match all known lists, add ~u to match only
	subscribed lists.  Normalise pattern ordering in docs. Closes:
	#2050.

	* configure.in, imap/auth_sasl.c, main.c, mutt_sasl.c,
	mutt_sasl.h, pop_auth.c: Remove obsolete Cyrus SASL 1.5 support.

	* doc/chunk.xsl, doc/html.xsl: Docbook support files, dropped
	in the initial commit.

	* doc/manual.sgml.tail, configure.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	doc/manual.sgml.head, makedoc.c: Convert documentation from

	as fatal.

2005-08-22 20:30:11  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* pgp.c: Pause after error message if PGP decode fails, in case
	mutt_copy_message overwrites.  Real error handling cleanup will
	have to wait...

	* pgp.c: Don't attempt to manipulate null pgp output file handles.

2005-08-16 18:10:11  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>	(brendan)

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/mutt.man, main.c: -D dumps to stdout,

	inconsistencies.

2005-08-12 23:06:25  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Turn off input buffering for gnutls SSL
	certificate menu, as we do in the openssl version.

	* imap/auth_sasl.c: Override SASL initial response if the server
	spoke first in its continuation response. Closes: #2034.

	* doc/Makefile.in: Degnuify mutt.1 make rule. Imagining a world
	in which gnu documentation flagged any extensions to standard
	utilities almost makes me cry.

	* Makefile.am, VERSION, reldate.h: Fix Makefile.am.

2005-08-11 21:16:38  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* copy.c, crypt-gpgme.c, crypt-gpgme.h, crypt-mod-pgp-classic.c,

	* configure.in: Don't test against nonexistent cache

2005-08-11 01:44:49  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mutt_sasl.c: Silence some compiler warnings.

2005-08-09 20:13:03  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in, doc/manual.sgml.tail: Replace raw latin1
	characters with entities, and enable latin output for
	manual.txt. I'm not sure this is ideal for non-latin (eg
	utf8) environments, but hopefully docbook will resolve this
	anyway. Closes: #2029.

	* doc/manual.sgml.head: Replace free ~ with &tilde;. Closes:
	#2030.

	* pgp.c: Move pgp failure check inside the if (invoke pgp)
	block. Should really Close: 2032.

	* pgp.c: Don't ftell pgp output file if there isn't one. Closes:

2005-08-09 16:10:40  Mads Martin Joergensen  <mmj@suse.de>  (brendan)

	* copy.c: Remove an unneeded cast, which introduces
	type-punning. Modified to use FREE instead of safe_free, since
	that seems to be the convention. I personally don't see the point.

2005-08-08 18:59:43  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mutt_socket.c: Pause for a moment when a hostname fails to
	resolve. Closes #1942.	There are a number of cases where mutt
	cascades error messages. It might be nice if there were an error
	stack so that low level functions could push_error instead of
	displaying it right away, and the higher level ones could eg
	mutt_message(_("Failed to write FCC: %s"), pop_error ())...

	* main.c: Document -d option in mutt -h output. Closes #2027.

	* init.h: Remove undefined reference to unmailboxes
	command. Closes #2028.

	* imap/imap.c: Fix edge case where we might have to wait two
	timeouts to check for IMAP mail.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, init.h: Fix bug just introduced
	in lsub parsing that could cause mutt to loop indefinitely.
	Don't recheck subscriptions at every mailbox change, just the
	initial connection.

	* imap/imap.c: If imap_check_subscribed is set, mailbox or
	unmailbox folders in response to subscribe/unsubscribe commands
	in the browser.

2005-08-07 23:52:08  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, init.h, mutt.h:
	New option: $imap_check_subscribed. If set, mutt will fetch the
	set of subscribed mailboxes from the server and add them to the
	buffy list.

	* browser.c: Avoid a segfault attempting to browse an invalid
	IMAP URL.

	* imap/imap.c: Extend IMAP host completion to complete over open
	connections. Next up: account and folder hooks.

	* imap/imap.c: Allow IMAP tab-completion to complete over
	defined mailboxes, saving a bunch of typing for the hostname
	part of the URL. Should probably be extended to complete over
	open connections and possibly also folder/account hooks.

	* account.c, curs_lib.c, protos.h: Reuse mutt_get_field for
	mutt_get_field_unbuffered.

	* pager.c: Certain versions of libc may segfault during regex
	processing if given incomplete multibyte characters. Work around
	this by manually trimming the display buffer. I modified it
	somewhat to only check when the situation is most likely to occur:
	fgets has read all the way to the capacity of the buffer. Thanks
	also to Tamo for his comments.

2005-08-07 04:58:12  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* account.c, curs_lib.c, protos.h: Make username prompts
	unbuffered like password prompts are (no more folder-hook push
	garbage)

2005-08-06 22:20:55  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c, lib.c, lib.h, mutt.h, mutt_tunnel.c, sendlib.c:
	Report non-zero exit status of tunnel command. Closes: #1749.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/util.c, init.h, mutt.h, pop_lib.c: Replace
	pointless imap_force_ssl option with ssl_force_tls, which
	requires any connection (POP or IMAP) to a remote server to
	be encrypted, and attempts to negotiate encryption even if the
	capability isn't advertised (this last bit is of dubious utility,
	but essentially harmless since the connection would otherwise
	fail anyway). Closes: #1284.

	* imap/browse.c: Kill a warning.

	* init.c: Use isalnum instead of isalpha when parsing unbraced
	environment variable names, per tamo's suggestion. Closes #2022.

2005-08-05 02:16:46  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* attach.c, attach.h, browser.c, curs_main.c, mutt.h, mutt_menu.h,
	pager.h, protos.h: Move some attachment-related prototypes and
	structures into attach.h from the global headers. A small step
	towards sane dependency tracking and code cleanliness.

2005-08-04 01:15:52  brendan  (brendan)

	* compose.c: Don't unlink non-mutt files that would have been
	unlinked on send if the message is cancelled.

2005-08-03 15:34:14  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* account.c: Fix C precedence buglet in getlogin preventing it
	from actually calling getuser.

	* mutt_ssl.c: Don't double-free X509 certificates. This patch
	looks wrong, but it isn't.

2005-08-02 18:15:33  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am, po/Makefile.in.in, po/POTFILES.in: Remove
	mutt_ssl_nss.c from POTFILES.in. Also hack the makefiles to build
	keymap_alldefs.h in $(top_srcdir), since that's where xgettext
	looks. Not super clean I guess - the other alternative is to
	sed POTFILES.

	* globals.h, init.c, init.h, mutt.h, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_socket.c,
	mutt_ssl.h, mutt_ssl_nss.c, pop_lib.c, configure.in: Put moribund
	NSS support out to pasture.

	* compose.c, mutt.h: In compose menu, detach should be able to
	unlink files generated by mutt, but not files that existed before.

	* commands.c, pgp.c: More fiddling with PGP results. When
	rerunning PGP on a message, clear old security result bits to
	avoid confusing messages like 'decrypt failed; PGP signature
	successfully verified'.

	* pgp.c: Forget passphrase on PGP/inline decryption error,
	and improve status line messages.

	* configure.in: Make $docdir relative to $prefix, like the
	other prefixes.

	* contrib/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in: Be more selective about
	what to remove during uninstall. (closes #1625)

	* pgp.c: Also forget passphrase when encrypt fails, if
	signing. (closes #1025 again)

	* imap/message.c: Check that the entire message downloaded
	successfully on fetch, and don't treat a disappearing cache file
	as fatal. (closes #1483)

	* compose.c: Don't unlink attachments that you've decided not
	to send. (closes #1328)

	* pgp.c: Bump up size of PgpPass to 1024 from 256. Seems crazy,
	but it's harmless and it (closes #1207).

	* account.c: Fix password prompt for POP (more authentication
	ID fallout).

2005-08-01 22:37:22  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.sgml.head: Document <backtab> key.

	* pgp.c: Automatically forget PGP passphrase on sign or decrypt
	error. (closes #1025)

	* pgp.c: Display "successfully decrypted" message instead of
	nothing. Superseded by signature verification.

	* commands.c, pgp.c: Don't report PGP signature could not be
	verified unless there really is a signature verification problem
	(not some other PGP error).

	* Makefile.am: Install system muttrc from the build directory,
	not the source directory.

	* mbox.c: Restore Sort immediately after sorting by mailbox
	order in mbox_sync_mailbox.  (closes #972)

	* doc/Makefile.in, doc/mutt.man: Insert compile-time paths to
	system resources into mutt.man. (closes #854)

	* commands.c, protos.h: Report errors occuring in
	_mutt_save_message. (closes #847)

	* globals.h, mutt.h, mutt_ssl.c, muttlib.c: Cache SSL certificates
	that have been accepted but not saved until mutt exits. (closes
	#643).	Create mutt_add_list_n for adding non-character data to
	lists, have mutt_add_list call it.

	* mx.c: Report error creating FCC when writing to IMAP
	server. Addresses #423.

	* init.c: complete :set mbox_type=<tab>. (closes #1649)

2005-07-30 04:40:45  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu	<ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>
(brendan)

	* pager.c: The builtin pager tries to wrap a line for ever if:
	0) the line contains a space or a tab character
	 followed by a very long word, and 1) M_PAGER_NSKIP flag is
	passed to it, and 2) $smart_wrap is set. (default)

2005-07-30 04:13:07  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c, pager.c: When using colors, the status line of
	the index is displayed in a >bright color, even when the prefix
	"bright" is *not* given in the foreground color. The problem
	occurs when I have the following additional line:
	  color normal brightwhite black The problem is that BKGDSET's
	are missing.

	* init.c: "nospam foo" causes a segv if you have not set any
	"spam", because of a null pointer dereference.

2005-07-29 06:45:14  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Tweak a poorly-worded error message in the
	gnutls glue, pointed out by Vincent Lefevre.

	* imap/imap.c: Fix bug added in revision 3.26, where
	imap_sync_mailbox failed to check whether it was supposed to
	expunge before issuing a CLOSE.

2005-07-28 20:42:45  ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp  (roessler)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix mutt/2004; S/MIME user interface differences
	between GPGME and classic.

2005-07-28 19:47:40  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/auth_cram.c, imap/auth_login.c: Use mutt_account_getlogin
	instead of getuser for authentication methods that only support
	an authentication ID. As a side-effect, don't display a dangling
	authentication name pointer in getpass.

2005-07-27 15:08:43  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	po/et.po, po/gl.po, po/lt.po, po/pt_BR.po, po/sk.po: Update
	Thomas' address in several out-of-date PO files. (closes #990)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Silence some harmless warnings. Also,
	one day -pedantic is going to get held up on the causeway.

	* imap/command.c: More fiddling with fatal state handling. Not
	tested, and probably as wrong as what was already there.

	* muttlib.c: Rework mutt_save_confirm to support confirmappend
	with IMAP mailboxes.  I hope I got all cases right.

2005-07-26 23:57:38  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c: Adjust imap_access so that it doesn't issue STATUS
	on the selected mailbox, and have imap_open_mailbox_append use
	imap_access instead of rolling its own.

	* enter.c: Introduce fall-back from complete-query to complete
	for the edit menu, so 'bind editor <tab> complete-query'
	becomes possible.

2005-07-26 06:14:34  "Brent J. Nordquist"  <brent@nordist.net>	(brendan)

	* mutt_ssl.c: Don't offer to save expired or not-yet-valid
	certificates. Closes #1943 as a side-effect.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h: Rework IMAP CLOSE handling
	to avoid expunging messages when exiting without saving
	changes. (closes #1899)

2005-07-25 04:37:20  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

2005-07-24 18:33:31  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* muttlib.c: Typo in last commit.

	* imap/message.c, muttlib.c, protos.h: Merge full envelope from
	message fetch into original sparse envelope, instead of replacing
	it. This should be gentler on the various threading hashes and may
	(knock on wood) fix the threading segfault. Threading behaviour
	is observably better.

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, main.c, protos.h, init.c: This patch
	adds an option -D to dump mutt's configuration after all
	configuration files have been read.  Changes against PW's version:
	(1) curses isn't initialized; (2) variables are dumped to stdout,
	not to stderr.

	* hash.c, imap/message.c, imap/util.c: This patch includes (1)

	segmentation fault in May.  There is no guarantee that this patch
	doesn't break things.  If it does, please complain to mutt-dev.

	* recvattach.c, smime.c: Fix S/MIME segmentation fault.  Bug

	* account.c, account.h, globals.h, init.h, mutt_sasl.c: Add
	$imap_login variable to specify which user to authenticate as
	($imap_user controls which user's mail gets accessed). Currently
	this can't be specified interactively, since I can't think of
	a way to do it that wouldn't annoy users where login == user
	(the default value of $imap_login).

	* init.h, menu.c, mutt.h: I've updated the menu_context patch to
	reintroduce the menu_move_off variable that hasn't made it into
	1.5.8. The patch fixes menu_prev_line and menu_next_line which
	didn't work with menu_context > 0 and also makes <current-middle>

	New function: rename-mailbox (bound to 'r' by default).

	The lack of a rename-mailbox command for IMAP finally got too
	annoying.  It's a bit of a cut-and-paste job, but I've put my
	dreams of cleaning up the IMAP codebase on hold. Gotta grow up
	some time.

	C file, but the results need testing in case some files depend
	on the current (broken) includes.

2005-01-31 02:40:14  brendan  (brendan)

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, hcache.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/message.c, m4/types.m4, protos.h: Begin removing deprecated
	autoconf 2.13 backward compatibility code.  Add AC_CHECK_TYPES

2005-01-29 19:15:07  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>
(roessler)

	* hcache.c: - make hcache.c conform to mutt codingstyle - use $Id$
	CVS keyword instead of %K% BitKeeper keyword

	* pgp.c: Adeotato points out that feof() only works after a read.
	So, we now check for an unsuccessful fgetc().

2005-01-28 14:50:31  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>	(roessler)

2005-01-27 20:17:46  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>
(roessler)

	* curs_main.c: this patch doesn't raise an error if you try
	to sync an empty mailbox which makes it possible to use such a
	macro as this on an empty mailbox:

	macro index y "<sync-mailbox><change-folder>?"	macro pager y

2005-01-27 18:48:41  Bill Nottingham  <notting@redhat.com>  (roessler)

	* mutt_sasl.c: With SASL, expect the server to prompt for
	additional auth data if we have some to send (#129961, upstream
	#1845)

	* contrib/sample.muttrc: Changes the sample.muttrc highlight to
	catch https URLs as well.

	* color.c, main.c: Support for the "default" color in Slang.

2005-01-27 18:45:37  Florian Weimer   <fw@deneb.enyo.de>  (roessler)

	* mh.c, configure.in: Read files in maildir folders in inode
	order; this seems to reduce seek overhead on Linux.  Enabled by
	default; to disable, run configure with --disable-inodesort.
	(By way of Mario d'Itri.)

2005-01-27 18:28:42  Marco d'Itri  <md@Linux.IT>  (roessler)

	* pgp.c: Improved good signature check.

	* contrib/gpg.rc, pgpinvoke.c: Make the default Muttrc work
	out the box for people using gnupg-agent.  Wrote and applied a
	one-line patch to make the %?p? conditional escape work correctly,
	patch forwarded upstream. (Closes: #277646)

	* pgpewrap.c: Don't segfault when invoked without any arguments.

	* contrib/gpg.rc, pgp.c: Evaluate gpg's machine-parseable status
	messages.

	* smime_keys.pl: Add some sanity checks to smime_keys.pl.

	* contrib/gpg.rc: A gpg command line contains both --verbose
	and --no-verbose, remove the first.

	* po/sv.po, po/ca.po, po/de.po, po/it.po: i18n updates.

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/mutt.man, doc/muttrc.man.head,

2005-01-11 12:15:13  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head: Document send2-hook.

	* send.c: send2-hook should also be executed after the first
	time the message is edited by the user.

2005-01-09 15:35:51  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

(roessler)

	* imap/imap_private.h: Having a signed one-bit bitfield is quite
	odd -- its value is either 0 or -1.  Although the current code
	is not broken because it doesn't test equality to 1, IMHO it's
	better not to use that.

	* imap/message.c: There's a size_t in imap_append_message not
	printed out portably.

2004-11-02 13:30:58  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

	safe_strcat, safe_strncat.  Thanks to Ulf H. for noting the
	wrong use of strncat in part of the mutt code base.

	* smime.c: Fix bad code in smime_get_field_from_db.  Problem noted
	by Ulf Härnhammar <Ulf.Harnhammar.9485@student.uu.se>.

2004-09-07 08:09:39  Matthias Andree  <matthias.andree@gmx.de>	(roessler)

	* prepare: Fix parameter passing.

2004-08-31 15:41:03  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* configure.in: Add AC_GNU_SOURCE.

	* recvattach.c: Remove *two* layers of S/MIME from messages
	before building the attachment tree.  A generic solution would
	remove intransparent encodings all the way down the tree.

2004-08-30 20:10:10  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* compose.c: Only print additional information related to PGP
	in case the current message is indeed to be encrypted/signed
	with PGP.

	* globals.h, init.h, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_ssl.c: Here's a patch
	to allow mutt to use SSL client certificates to authenticate
	itself. To use, set ssl_client_cert to the path to your
	certificate file (containing both the certificate and the private
	key). It works with the SASL EXTERNAL authentication mechanism,
	so you'll need to have SASL enabled as well.

	* init.c: Fix a memory leak in the generic spam detection code.

	* muttlib.c, protos.h: This wipes duplicated code, which I

2004-08-16 21:37:43  Adeodato Simó  <asp16@alu.ua.es>  (roessler)

	* headers.c: as of current cvs, setting "PGP: E" (or similar)
	when header-editing a message does not work. the OP is set
	(ENCRYPT, SIGN, whatever) but APPLICATION_PGP is missing.

2004-08-16 21:36:38  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c: If STARTTLS fails to complete the SSL handshake,
	the error is not propagated and mutt will attempt to log in
	anyway, probably causing an infinite block on read. The attached
	patch closes the socket in this case, and propagates the error
	properly.

	* imap/auth_sasl.c: The attached patch causes mutt to attempt
	the next method in imap_authenticators if the previous method
	failed, even if the server reported that the method was
	available. Previously mutt would give up if any authentication
	method failed.

2004-08-16 21:34:22  Moritz Schulte   <moritz@g10code.com>  (roessler)

	* compose.c: Only print "Encrypt with" field in case the used
	S/MIME modules supports this feature.

2004-07-19 21:41:43  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (roessler)

	It's not clear to me that this is really the right approach.
	Revisit Editor/Visual some time.

2004-07-14 05:19:15  Elmar Hoffmann  <mutt-dev-ml@elho.net>  (roessler)

	* init.h, mutt.h, thread.c: By default Mutt hides the subject
	of messages in the thread tree that have the same subject as
	their parent or closest previously displayed sibling. This patch
	makes this optional, introducing the hide_thread_subject boolean
	setting which defaults to the old behaviour.

	* copy.c, copy.h, handler.c, init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Fix a cvs

	(which, erroneously, hadn't been committed automatically).

	done on the search for a problem that ultimately turned out to
	be a configuration issue. Still, the changed code could come in
	handy some day.)

	so it behaves the same way as the PGP send menu.

2004-06-17 20:36:13  Moritz Schulte  <moritz@g10code.com>  (roessler)

	* Makefile.am, compose.c, configure.in, crypt-mod-pgp-classic.c,

	mutt.h, mutt_crypt.h, mutt_curses.h, pgp.c, pgp.h, smime.c,
	smime.h: This is the sequel to the crypto modularization changes
	I did on 2003-01-21.  Moritz added another abstraction layer
	which cleans up the code and allows the crypto modules to use
	their own option menu.	Everything should work as it used to
	but is now in a really good shape for part III, the Return of
	the GnuPG Easy Makers. -wk

	* crypt-mod-pgp-classic.c, crypt-mod-smime-classic.c, crypt-mod.c,
	crypt-mod.h: New files.

	Adjust WithCrypto definition since the GPGME backend does not
	exclude anymore the other `classic' backends.  (KEYFLAG_ISX509):
	New symbol.  * mutt.h (enum): New symbol: OPTCRYPTUSEGPGME.
	(struct body): New member: is_signed_data, warnsig.  * main.c
	(main): Call crypt_init.  * keymap.c (km_get_table): Support for

	MENU_KEY_SELECT_SMIME.	* keymap.h (enum): New enum symbols:
	MENU_KEY_SELECT_PGP, MENU_KEY_SELECT_SMIME.  * init.h:
	New configuration variable: crypt_use_gpgme.  * compose.c
	(pgp_send_menu, smime_send_menu): Removed functions, they are now
	contained in the crypto backend modules.  (mutt_compose_menu):
	Use crypt_pgp_send_menu and crypt_smime_send_menu instead
	pgp_send_menu and smime_send_menu.  * cryptglue.c: Slightly
	rewritten in order to make use of the module mechanism used to
	access crypto backends.  * curs_lib.c (mutt_need_hard_redraw):
	New function.  * crypt.c (crypt_forget_passphrase): Adjust
	for new crypto backend interface.  (crypt_valid_passphrase):
	Stripped, use calls to crypt_pgp_valid_passphrase and
	crypt_smime_valid_passphrase.

	* commands.c, curs_main.c, mutt.h, mutt_crypt.h, pager.c,
	recvattach.c: A belated fix for #1808 (Debian #233106): Make
	sure check-traditional-pgp doesn't leave the pager context

2004-02-08 09:38:38  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* muttlib.c: Change the logic in mutt_open_read to only
	catch directories -- mutt may legitimately read devices (think
	/dev/null) or named pipes. Also delegate error reporting to the
	calling function by setting errno.

	* mbox.c: Hi, off_t is a 64-bit number (like on Mac OS X/darwin),
	the percentages don't show right while mutt is reading/parsing
	a mailbox.  Here's a patch (against 1.5.6i) to fix that.

2004-02-07 21:36:41  David Yitzchak Cohen
<lists+mutt_devs@bigfatdave.com>  (roessler)

	* init.c, muttlib.c: Looking at the code, the problem is pretty
	obvious.  A recent patch to init.c (the one that was supposed
	to prevent Mutt from silently failing to read nonexistant RC
	files, IIRC) changed source_rc() to stat(2) the RC "file" before
	trying to mutt_open_read() it.	There's only one problem here:
	source_rc() has no way of knowing whether or not its "file"
	is a file or a command.  I'm attaching a patch that fixes the
	problem in what I believe is the right way.

2004-02-01 18:00:16  Mike Schiraldi  <1074468571@schiraldi.org>
(roessler)

	* init.c: As you all know, running "mutt -F foo.rc" will have
	mutt read foo.rc as its config file. However, there is a bug --
	if you specify a directory (like accidentally typing "mutt -F
	/etc/mutt") mutt will silently ignore the flag and leave you
	wondering why it isn't working.

	Emil Sit posted a patch for this in March of 2002, but it seems
	to have slipped through the cracks. Here's the patch again;
	please consider it for inclusion.

	* pgpkey.c: KeyTable is pgp_uid_t **, not pgp_key_t *.	Fix some
	sizeof statements accordingly.	Note that pgp_key_t is also a
	pointer, though, so this should not have broken things.

(roessler)

	* lib.c: mutt_basename() was garbage.

	* doc/manual.sgml.head: Fix some tags.	Noted by Todd
	<Freedom_Lover@pobox.com>.

	* recvattach.c, attach.h, commands.c, compose.c, keymap.h, lib.c,
	lib.h, menu.c, mutt.h, mutt_menu.h, muttlib.c, pager.c, protos.h:
	This patch fixes various aspects of the attachment-saving user
	interface.  Changes include:

	* When tagging and saving multiple attachments, you can now use
	  the same target directory for multiple attachments.

	* When you can't save an attachment, you get an opportunity to
	  enter a new file name.

	* The menu cursor will highlight the attachment that you are
	  currently discussing with mutt.

	* Various bug fixes.

	This does, in particular, address #1619 (Debian#208430).

	* menu.c: Fix #1656.

2003-09-19 13:03:26  Mads Martin Joergensen  <mmj@suse.de>  (roessler)

	* imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, parse.c, pgp.c, pgpkey.c,

	edit.c, enter.c, handler.c, lib.c, lib.h, mh.c, mutt_idna.c, mx.c,
	pager.c: As the ones of you who compile with new gcc's probably
	have noticed, there's a lot of type-punning in Mutt. With help
	from Philipp Thomas, I've fixed all I could find in CVS (please
	double-check, one might have slipped through the cracks), I can
	make one for 1.4 CVS branch as well if wanted.

	* send.c: Change abort_unmodified so it doesn't abort a message
	that has an attachment.  Catches the "send a file from the
	command line, quickly" case.

2003-09-11 16:59:54  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* mutt_sasl.c: This trivial patch closes #1516 (NI_WITHSCOPEID
	undefined). Thanks to Mads for the initial patch.

	earlier commit.  -tlr)

2003-09-10 13:20:49  Jon Miles	<jon@zetnet.net>  (roessler)

	* pop_auth.c: In pop_auth.c:pop_auth_sasl(), if the main loop
	received anything back from the server that didnt begin with '+
	', it was bailing out and skipping the checks to see if there
	was a +OK response.

	& encrypted.

2003-09-03 17:22:09  Dan Born  <dan@danborn.net>  (roessler)

	* postpone.c: I've attached a patch for bug number 1036, as
	reported at http://bugs.guug.de/db/pa/lmutt.html ("segfault
	when more than one msg is postponed").	This is a patch against
	mutt 1.4.1.

	As it was previously left, no one could reproduce it.  The problem
	occurs because sorting is disabled when opening the postponed
	folder, but the Sort global variable still tells mutt to use
	whatever sorting algorithm the $sort config option indicates.
	Eventually, the code would get to mutt_messages_in_thread and
	try to dereference a NULL thread object, causing the segfault.

	<rob@terizla.org>.

2003-09-03 17:09:09  Anatoly Vorobey  <mellon@pobox.com>  (roessler)

	* curs_main.c: The commands "read-thread" (^R) and
	"read-subthread" (Esc-R) do not honor the resolve variable (don't
	advance cursor after marking the thread/subthread as read),
	which, to me at least, is a nuisance.

2003-08-11 14:06:08  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c: 1595: My guess is this bug is caused by
	mlarson@verisign.com's patch to check for UNSEEN rather than
	RECENT messages. This means that as long as there are messages
	in a mailbox either new or old, mutt will think it has new mail.

	The attached patch reverts that change. Let me know if it solves
	the problem.

2003-08-11 14:05:13  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

	* attach.c, buffy.c, commands.c, copy.c, editmsg.c, init.c,

2003-07-29 10:11:05  Edmund GRIMLEY EVANS  <edmundo@rano.org>  (roessler)

	* pager.c: It seems that Solaris has an incorrect implementation
	of mbrtowc: when there is an encoding error and mbrtowc returns
	(size_t)(-1) no value should be stored in *pwc (the first
	argument), as I understand it, but here mbrtowc is storing 8
	when presented with the bytes "\xc8\x4d".

	However, relying on mbrtowc not to store anything in *pwc when
	there is an error is a bit silly; it makes sense to look at
	the return value. So, the following patch should be applied if
	Pawel can confirm that it fixes the problem. I've tested it and
	it worked for me with glibc's mbrtowc.

2003-07-24 18:40:50  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (roessler)

	* alias.c, copy.c, handler.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/message.c, imap/util.c, init.c, intl/l10nflist.c,
	intl/loadmsgcat.c, intl/localealias.c, keymap.c, lib.c,
	makedoc.c, muttlib.c, pattern.c, rfc2047.c, rfc2231.c, rfc822.c,
	strcasecmp.c, url.c: Some functions/macros like isspace take an
	int and require the argument to have the value of an unsigned char
	(or EOF). Under Solaris, gcc complains when the argument is a char
	(as this is a possible bug, on platforms where char is signed,
	like Solaris). The attached patch fixes such problems (well,
	perhaps I've changed more than necessary, but this doesn't hurt).

2003-07-22 12:56:38  dshaw@jabberwocky.com  (roessler)

	* gnupgparse.c: When encrypting a message to a user that has more
	than one subkey, at least one of which is revoked or expired,
	mutt treats the entire key as unusable rather than just the
	subkey(s) in question.

2003-07-16 11:18:12  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* account.c, account.h, imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/imap.c: I noticed
	that my mutt hung when I tried SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication
	(I'm not sure when this started). I believe this patch should
	solve that problem in a reliable way.

	This patch also attempts to reuse connections even when
	authentication fails, instead of just throwing away a perfectly
	good socket.

	* curs_lib.c, enter.c, keymap.c, keymap.h, mutt.h, mutt_curses.h,
	mutt_ssl.c: This patch redoes yesterday's unbuffered input
	patch. Now it uses a pseudo-option, which means less mess to carry
	down the call stack.  It also made it much easier to have the SSL
	certificate menu be unbuffered, which it is now. So push commands
	won't annoy you when entering passwords or accepting certificates.

2003-07-15 11:41:32  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* curs_main.c, globals.h, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap.h, imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c, mx.c: The attached
	patch should keep all opened IMAP connections alive, no matter
	what mailbox you are currently in. With the patch that got
	committed yesterday, this should close bug 1523.

	(There was a typo in that patch. This one supersedes it.)

	* configure.in, .cvsignore: autoconf 2.5 compatibility.

2003-07-14 12:40:03  Hugo Haas	<hugo@larve.net>  (roessler)

	* send.c: Fix #1520.

	I dug a little deeper. The attached patch seems to work better. It
	complains the first time you try to recall a message, but works
	the second.

	* account.c, curs_lib.c, enter.c, keymap.c, keymap.h, mutt.h,
	mutt_curses.h: The attached patch prevents mutt from reading the
	push buffer when asking for passwords. This is a proper fix for

	* OPS, curs_lib.c, curs_main.c, functions.h, menu.c: Introduce
	tag-prefix-cond and end-cond.  This makes simple conditional
	execution of parts of macros possible.

2003-07-04 17:03:51  Bruno Postle  <bruno@postle.net>  (roessler)

	* curs_main.c, pattern.c: Display an empty index when no messages

2003-07-04 16:57:56  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* init.h, muttlib.c: Add a ':' flag to % expandos.  This will
	make sure that any dots are converted into underscores.  (_
	is already used for lowercasing the result of an expando.)

2003-06-04 14:01:39  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

2003-05-29 17:48:28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c, pgp.c, po/eo.po, po/id.po: Fix part of #1564.

2003-05-29 17:47:10  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* init.c: Fix a segmentation fault which would occur when
	pgp_sort_keys is set in a configuration file, but mutt is compiled
	without PGP support.

	* gnupgparse.c: Fix PGP subkey handling when looking at key
	capabilities.  This should take care of the recent "mutt does
	not see all keys" problems.

	* recvattach.c: view-attachments does not extract the message
	within a x-pkcs7-mime if it's only signed, but not encrypted.
	Such a message results, for example, from a decrypt-save if the
	message was previously encrypted and signed.

2003-05-13 12:45:35  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>

	* doc/manual.sgml.head: Fix an inconsistency between manual
	and code.

2003-05-13 12:43:45  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>  (roessler)

	* gnupgparse.c, pgppubring.c: Currently, mutt uses the OpenPGP key
	algorithm to determine the capabilities of the key.  For example,
	in mutt, a key of type 1 (RSA) can both encrypt & sign.  This is
	not correct as per OpenPGP, however, where the capabilities of
	the key are determined by both the algorithm and key capability
	flags that are set on the key.	This can lead to user confusion
	when their RSA encrypt-only or sign-only key is listed for both
	signing and encryption in mutt.

	GnuPG lists these flags in key listings, so it is easy to take
	advantage of them.  Here is a patch to use the flags, as well
	as provide the flags in pgpring.  Note that the pgp+pgpring
	users won't see any change since the flags there are based on
	the key algorithm as they are now, but the GnuPG users will see
	an improvement.

	* enter.c: Fix alias completion when the alias is entered as

2003-05-03 20:07:40  Dan Nelson  <dnelson@allantgroup.com>  (roessler)

(roessler)

	* compose.c: The "sign (a)s" code strips the pgp application
	bit causing drawing issues in redraw_crypt_lines().  Other bits
	(well bit = encrypt) are ignored as a result.  I've only tested
	with pgp, but the same problem exists in the smime code too.
	This inline patch (against cvs head revision) fixes the problem.

2003-04-14 09:09:53  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Fix the PGP / S/MIME selection mess
	in send.c.  This patch adds two new configuration variables,
	$crypt_autopgp and $crypt_autsmime.  Both are set to "yes"
	by default.  By turning them off, you can disable the automatic
	selection of one or both mechanisms.  (Useful when your mutt is
	PGP- and S/MIME enabled, but you only use, say S/MIME.)

	* init.h, mutt.h, pgp.c: Here is the pgp_check_exit patch
	updated for 1.5.4.  This patch adds the pgp_check_exit option
	(enabled by default) that causes mutt to check the exit code
	of the PGP subprocess.	A non-zero exit code means that the
	subprocess failed and mutt will not continue to send the message.

	This is needed as in certain cases, PGP or GnuPG can fail to
	completely process a document (say, if the gpg.conf file is
	mangled, which is how I discovered the problem).  Without an
	exit code check, mutt will continue anyway and send the half

2003-03-19 21:56:29  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* pgppubring.c: Fix some memory management calls. (Stable branch.)

2003-03-19 21:33:30  Edmund GRIMLEY EVANS  <edmundo@rano.org>  (roessler)

	* imap/utf7.c: Fix a buffer overflow in utf8_to_utf7. (Stable
	branch.)

	* imap/utf7.c: Fix a buffer overflow in utf8_to_utf7.

2003-03-18 14:51:52  Andrew W. Nosenko	<awn@bcs.zp.ua>  (roessler)

	* buffy.c, parse.c: - buffy.c (test_last_status_new): Fix memory
	  leak.  Envelope structure allocated by mutt_read_rfc822_header()
	  was never deallocated.

	- parse.c (mutt_read_rfc822_header): Comment added about
	  needing deallocate envelope structure returned by
	  mutt_read_rfc822_header().

	* mutt_idna.c: (mutt_addr_for_display): Fix memory leak.  `user'
	and `domain' buffers was never deallocated.

	(mbox_to_udomain): Fix memory leak.  `scratch' buffer was not
	deallocated when `mbx' doesn't contain '@'. Also rewritten for
	allocating memory only when needed and only how many as needed.

2003-03-12 13:00:03  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* copy.c, sendlib.c: We need to re-format address headers instead
	of just decoding them.

2003-03-07 14:55:53  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* mutt_sasl.c: The global callbacks set up in sasl_client_init
	are not copied by the SASL library, so they can't be allocated
	on the stack. This is the case with both versions of the SASL
	library, and I frankly don't understand why it hasn't caused
	problems before. Since it segfaults reliably on OS X for me now,
	I thought a patch would be in order.

2003-03-07 08:23:27  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* crypt.c, pgp.h: Don't use functions without importing the
	corresponding prototype.

	* mutt_idna.c: It seems like libidn doesn't like to translate
	NULL pointers.

2003-03-07 07:52:49  Jim Mock  <mij@soupnazi.org>  (roessler)

	* globals.h: globals.h is looking for crypt.h instead of
	mutt_crypt.h.

2003-03-06 21:23:53  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* send.c: Fixing a segmentation fault.	Here's how to reproduce
	it: Start mutt.  Compose a new message, with an attachment.
	Turn on PGP signing.  Press C-G on the pass phrase prompt.
	Turn off PGP signing.  Try to send the message.

2003-03-05 21:18:24  Andrew W. Nosenko	<awn@bcs.zp.ua>  (roessler)

	* protos.h, sort.c: Fix a warning.

	* mutt_idna.c: Fix tlr's pre-processor screw-up.

2003-03-04 09:51:07  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* mutt_idna.c, mutt_socket.c: Unset UseSTD3ASCIIRules, and set
	AllowUnassigned.  (Just reading some standards.)

2003-03-04 09:31:19  Edmund GRIMLEY EVANS  <edmundo@rano.org>  (roessler)

	* handler.c: Be more friendly about bad multipart/alternative
	bodies; #1478. Note that the relevant standards explicitly
	*forbid* nested MIME encodings.

2003-03-04 09:27:21  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* copy.c: Fix another stupid error, and decode IDNs in the
	CC header.

	* init.h: Fix two typos in one line.  Noted by Thomas Glanzmann
	and Steve Kennedy.

	* addrbook.c, alias.c, send.c: Fixing more IDN bugs.

2003-03-03 14:25:14  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* copy.c, sort.c: Fixing some nits.

	* mutt_socket.c: IDNA support for the socket back-end.

	* Makefile.am, addrbook.c, alias.c, charset.h, commands.c,
	compose.c, configure.in, copy.c, edit.c, hdrline.c, headers.c,
	init.c, main.c, mutt_idna.c, mutt_idna.h, pgpinvoke.c,
	protos.h, query.c, recvcmd.c, rfc822.c, rfc822.h, send.c,
	sendlib.c: IDN support for e-mail messages.  Things should work
	automagically once you have the GNU IDN library available from
	ftp://alpha.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libidn/ installed.	For IDN's which
	can't be losslessly recoded to your local character set, mutt
	should automatically fall back to using the ASCII representation.
	There's probably a considerable number of bugs in this, and the
	code may, at this point, not even compile on machines without
	libidn.  Will start working on that ASAP.

	* contrib/sample.muttrc, doc/manual.sgml.head, recvcmd.c,
	commands.c, init.h, mutt.h: Introduce a new option named
	$bounce, and fix some inconsistencies in the messages created
	when bouncing.	Based on work done by Thomas Glanzmann
	<sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>.

2003-02-25 22:00:38  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* commands.c, recvcmd.c: Fix some (too lazy and tired to do all)
	of the inconsistencies between message and attachment bouncing.

	* crypt.c: I should test-compile things before committing.
	Stupid typo.

2003-02-25 21:41:32  Michael Elkins  <me@sigpipe.org>  (roessler)

	* query.c: Use mutt_strwidth for query response formatting.
	(#1477)

2003-02-25 21:37:59  Christian Vogel  <vogelchr@vogel.cx>  (roessler)

	* mx.c: Recognize MH folders used by sylpheed.

2003-02-25 21:35:24  jesus.climent@hispalinux.es  (roessler)

	* po/es.po: Fix a typo. (#1482)

2003-02-25 21:33:16  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* doc/manual.sgml.head: Remove some ftp.guug.de URLs from the
	manual. (#1485)

	* crypt.c: Fix #1486; noted by Jeroen Coekaerts
	<jeroen@coekaerts.be>.

2003-02-19 21:33:43  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>  (roessler)

	* pgpmicalg.c: 3156 defined several micalg values (pgp-md5,
	pgp-sha1, etc.)  Since then, three more hashes have been assigned
	numbers in 2440bis.  Here is a patch to add values for pgp-sha256,
	pgp-sha384, and pgp-sha512 so mutt can properly handle them.

2003-02-19 21:31:19  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* parse.c: Fix a memory leak observed by Vineet Kumar
	<mutt-dev@virtual.doorstop.net>.

2003-02-13 09:55:02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>  (roessler)

	* init.h: Here are some updates to the muttrc docs (spell check,
	language tweaks, etc).	No functional changes - this is just
	language stuff.

2003-02-13 09:50:00  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* pgp.c: Fix #1444, Debian #178563.  The details of this problem
	were tracked down by Steven Barker <steve@blckknght.org>.

2003-01-31 00:15:03  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* init.h: Change the default for crypt_replyencrypt back to "yes".
	Noted by Thomas Poindessous in Debian bug #178899; also #1448.

	* pgp.c: Fix #1442 (thanks, Dale); properly initialize some
	pointers which could otherwise lead to crashes.

2003-01-30 23:54:30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>  (roessler)

	* crypt.c, init.h, mutt.h, mutt_crypt.h, send.c: Introduce
	$pgp_auto_traditional.

2003-01-30 23:48:36  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* flags.c: The IMAP ACL patch broke things.

2003-01-23 22:05:02  Nathan Dushman  <nhd+mutt@andrew.cmu.edu>	(roessler)

	* pop_auth.c: SASL2 support for popo_auth.c.

	* curs_main.c, flags.c, imap/imap.c, pager.c: The attached
	patch provides improved support for IMAP ACLs (on servers that
	support them).	This means that mutt will now write the Seen
	flag in mailboxes that allow it, even if the mailbox doesn't
	allow other changes.

2003-01-23 22:01:03  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* handler.c: Automatically use the text/plain handler for text/*
	body parts which don't have a handler of their own.

2003-01-21 18:56:10  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* cryptglue.c: Fix a typo which broke pgp-extract-traditional.

	* mutt_crypt.h: Fix an #ifdef.

2003-01-21 12:33:41  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>  (roessler)

	* Makefile.am, acconfig.h, attach.c, commands.c, compose.c,
	 configure.in, copy.c, copy.h, crypt.c, cryptglue.c, curs_main.c,
	 functions.h, globals.h, gnupgparse.c, handler.c, hdrline.c,
	 headers.c, hook.c, init.c, init.h, keymap.c, keymap.h,
	 main.c, mutt.h, mutt_crypt.h, muttlib.c, mx.c, pager.c,
	 parse.c, pattern.c, pgp.c, pgp.h, pgpkey.c, pgplib.c, pgplib.h,
	 pgppubring.c, pop.c, postpone.c, protos.h, recvattach.c, send.c,
	 sendlib.c, smime.c, smime.h, sort.h:  - To cleanup the pgp/smime
	 code and prepare for other backends.  - Support gpg-agent by
	 not asking for a passphrase - autconf cleanups.

	This is just a start and probably we need a couple of other things
	to do. One drawback is that the help menu does always list all
	crypto realted stuff even when configured for no crypto at all.
	Same goes for the configure options but I consider thsi a feature:
	It allows to use the same .muttrc for different versions of mutt -
	at least during development, this is an advantage.  This all might
	be fixed but requires some changes to the configuration system.

	Note, the use of the WithCrypto macro - it enables the compiler
	to do dead-code-elimination depending on the configured backend.
	This is better readable than all the nested ifdefs.  I did some
	short tests and it seems to work, althoug mutt's size does not
	change largely when compiled w/o crypto.

	cryptglue.c is new as a warpper to all crypto calls; some are
	still in crypt.c but they should eventually also be wrapped.
	We don't use function pointers to keep a path to use dlopen or
	runtime configured backends.  crypt.h is also new and replaces
	pgp.h and smime.h in most files (except for the backend).

	* pgppubring.c: Don't make a "hard" transition to the new GnuPG
	syntax in pgpring.  This change undoes one of David Shaw's
	changes which were just committed.

2003-01-09 17:24:41  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>  (roessler)

	* gnupgparse.c, pgppubring.c: The latest GnuPG has new abilities
	to work with disabled keys.  Part of this change will eventually
	involve moving the 'd' that indicates a disabled key to a
	different part of the key listing.

	To smooth this transition, as of version 1.2.2, GnuPG will
	start giving the 'd' in both places (and will do this for a good
	long time).

	Here is a patch so mutt will accept either the old or new syntax.

2003-01-09 17:23:23  dshaw@jabberwocky.com  (roessler)

	* curs_lib.c: A recent change causes all mutt_yesorno prompts
	to come out as [yes]/yes or [no]/no.  Here's a fix.

2003-01-05 22:16:02  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* smime_keys.pl: Error checking for the creation of the temporary
	directory; also, use file mode 0700.

2003-01-05 22:08:25  Bjoern Jacke  <bjoern@j3e.de>  (roessler)

2003-01-05 22:02:37  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* commands.c: Another mutt_yesorno() change, in order to correctly
	interpret a C-g.

2003-01-05 22:00:00  Armin Wolfermann  <aw@osn.de>  (roessler)

	* recvcmd.c, send.c, alias.c, attach.c, commands.c, curs_lib.c,
	main.c, muttlib.c, mx.c, pgpkey.c: Fix a number of invocations
	of mutt_yesorno(): Always explicitly use the M_YES and M_NO
	constants.  Fixes a couple of cases in which C-g would be
	mis-interpreted.

2003-01-03 18:07:36  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

	* pgp.c: Detect in-line key material when checking for traditional
	PGP messages.

2002-12-22 20:04:51  René Clerc  <rene@clerc.nl>  (roessler)

	* po/nl.po: update

2002-12-22 20:01:32  Bjoern Jacke  <bjoern@j3e.de>  (roessler)

	* smime_keys.pl: Remove an unnecessary invocation of "cat";
	call openssl with the full path.

2002-12-22 11:20:00  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (roessler)

	* po/fr.po: Another fr.po update for the CVS (taking into account
	the change in pgpkey.c:486)...

2002-12-22 11:17:24  Martin Michlmayr  <tbm@cyrius.com>  (roessler)

	* hdrline.c, init.h: Add %A to the format strings, which expands
	to the reply-to address (if present) or to the author's address
	when there's no Reply-To header.

	documentation of pgp-hook/crypt-hook.

	* pgpkey.c: Don't bother the user with weak keys when there's
	a strong one.  Experimental, based on discussions on mutt-dev.

	* cvslog2changelog.pl: Identify both the author of a change and
	the one who committed it to the CVS in the changelog.

2002-12-18 17:29:56  Sahil Tandon  <sahil@brandeis.edu>  (me)

	* init.h:	I found a small typo in the manual, specifically
		at this[1] URL.  The description of the smart_wrap
		variable reads: "Controls the display of lines longer
		then the screen width in the internal pager."  The word
		_then_ should be _than_ if I'm not mistaken.

	bandwidth is expensive...  ;-)

	* keymap.c: Make the messages from the what-key function
	internationalizable.

	* crypt.c, crypt.h, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c, pgp.h, smime.c, smime.h:

	* OPS, curs_main.c, functions.h: Experimental: Introduce
	{next,previous}-new-then-unread.  These functions behave
	like {next,previous}-new as long as new messages are visible.
	When no new messages are visibuel any more, there's a fall-back
	to {next,prev}-unread.

	Derek D. Martin <ddm@sophic.org> for the excellent observation.
	(In addition to the fix proper, some tracking of temporary files
	is added to mutt's debugging output.)

	* browser.c, complete.c, hook.c, init.c, lib.c, lib.h: Herbert
	Martin Dietze <herbert@the-little-red-haired-girl.org> notes that
	mutt may currently build IMAP URLs like imap://exchange//herbert
	for FCCs.  The fix in this patch is to include a function named
	mutt_concat_path which concatenates path elements, but avoids
	the creation of double slashes.  (These don't create problems
	when you're just accessing the file system, but apparently thy
	do cause problems with IMAP.)

	* pager.c: Try to make search-next behave more closely to what
	people are used to, again.  The behaviour introduced by this
	patch will give you the previous search string as the default,

	the search string.

	* PATCHES: Ups.

2002-12-09 17:44:28  Michael Elkins  <me@sigpipe.org>  (roessler)

	* OPS, PATCHES, curs_main.c, functions.h, keymap.c, keymap.h,
	menu.c: This patch adds two features to mutt:

	- you can now specify the octal code of a key in a bind or
	  macro function, using the syntax <NNN>.  Eg, bind index <541>
	  show-version This allows you to bind to a function key for
	  which Mutt doesn't have a friendly name associated with it.

	- adds a what-key function which allows you to press a key and
	  have mutt show you the decimal/octal value.  (not bound to
	  anything by default)

	mutt_sasl.c, mutt_sasl.h: Hi - this is a patch against mutt-1.4
	to use version 2 of the Cyrus SASL library; all changes are
	ifdef'd so as not to break SASLv1 support. This includes a patch
	to configure.in to allow the choice between v1 and v2, but someone
	with a better understanding of autoconf should double-check it.

2002-11-12 08:00:51  Michael Elkins  <me@sigpipe.org>  (roessler)

	* handler.c: Actually commit patch-1.5.1.me.long_qp.2.

2002-11-11 19:16:11  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* alias.c, init.c, protos.h: patch-1.5-tlr.alias-parse.1 -
	extension of patch-1.5.1-me.aliascheck.1

	This patch catches the same kind of bad alias names caught by
	Michael's patch.  There are some extensions:

	1. Mutt makes sure that it doesn't _suggest_ bad names to
	the user.  2. If a name is bad, the user is informed, and may
	elect to fix the
	   name.  In this case, mutt will automatically suggest a fixed
	   version.
	3. If the user insists in the bad name, it's written into the
	   aliases file with proper quoting.
	4. When mutt parses the aliases file, it now uses the normal
	   tokenizer routines in order to properly handle quoted alias
	   names.

2002-11-11 18:36:25  Michael Elkins  <me@sigpipe.org>  (roessler)

	'Catch' is good but also to encode it is better. It may have
	been too late (sorry for that) so I fixed it. I don't know why
	the current source only escapes lines that actually begin with
	'from' or 'From' followed by some text. I think that escaping
	'from' or 'From' on a single line should be done, too.

	Not a big deal, anyways.

	* m4/gssapi.m4: Okay, two bugs here. One's an oversight of mine
	in my previous patch, where I tried to use "[hH]" as Bourne code
	while m4 had quoting set to ([, ]) -- this probably makes mutt
	mis-detect Heimdal after all.

	The other is not mine (i.e., it's in cvs now) and it makes mutt
	overstrike $LIBS if Heimdal or MIT Kerberos is detected. This is
	a problem for anyone who needs -lnsl -lsocket, in particular. I
	was fixing this by hand during late 1.3.x releases, as I didn't
	have time to track it down....

	Here's a patch against the current (unpatched) 1.5 cvs copy of
	m4/gssapi.m4. It probably should go into both branches. Sorry
	for the repeats.

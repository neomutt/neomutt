	Langerman <lfalse@paul.rutgers.edu> to mutt-users.

Fri Dec 11 20:48:14 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* reldate.h, VERSION, ChangeLog: 0.94.999 pre-release commit.

	* Makefile.am: The distdir target creates hard links for the
	source files.  This has the consequence that the us-dist
	hook will demolish files in the main source tree.  We have
	to un-link the various instances of the source code.

	* INSTALL: Warn about regexp-related problems under Solaris 2.6.

	* po/uk.po, po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/fr.po, po/es.po, po/de.po:
	Various last-minute changes and automatic updates.

	* main.c: Go into no-mailbox mode if the initial folder was
	given explicitly (-f) and can't be opened.

	* mh.c: Undoing the mh_speed patch.

	* po/it.po, po/fr.po: l10n fixes.

	* curs_main.c: Start a new reply and postpone it. Then type
	m (mail), and recall and send the postponed reply. The
	replied message is _not_ flagged replied.

	(From Byrial Jensen.)

	* po/fr.po: Bug-fixed french l10n.

	* parse.c: Multipart parser fixes from Byrial.  Finally.

	* po/it.po: Small fix.

Thu Dec 10 22:48:56 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* po/fr.po, configure.in: Add the french l10n.

	* po/uk.po, po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/es.po, po/de.po, reldate.h:
	post-release commit 0.94.99.

	* VERSION, README, ChangeLog: Pre-release commit for 0.94.99.

	* menu.c: Fix tag-prefix.

Thu Dec 10 11:06:25 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* menu.c: Fix tag-prefix.

	* compose.c:
	Redraw fix after the content type was changed on the compose menu.

Tue Dec  8 23:09:53 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* help.c: Help screen resizing nit.  From Gero Treuner.

	* doc/manual.sgml.in: Typo.

	* sendlib.c:
	Work around sendmail 8.9.1a invalidating PGP/MIME signatures by
	re-ordering MIME headers in the way sendmail does.

	* mh.c:
	Keep track of file name changes for files wandering around between
	the subfolders of a maildir.

	* mh.c:
	More fixes to the maildir resynchronization code.  This should now
	also smoothly handle the case of messages _vanishing_ from maildir's
	new/ subdirectory.

	* init.c: Make the debug file access unbuffered.  Important if we are
	debugging crashes.

Mon Dec  7 21:13:44 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* mx.c, mh.c:
	Fix a couple of flag-related bugs in the maildir folder update code.

	* imap.c: Fix a completely ugly comment formatting.

	* mutt.h: Adjust '#' to the first column.

	* rfc2047.c: Don't tag us-ascii headers as $Charset or unknown-8bit.

Thu Dec  3 23:29:37 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* po/uk.po, po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/es.po, po/de.po,
	reldate.h, VERSION, ChangeLog: release-commit 0.94.18.

Wed Dec  2 20:12:35 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* contrib/Pine.rc, contrib/Mush.rc:
	Bring the sample rc files better in synch with the actual code.

Wed Dec  2 20:12:35 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* contrib/Pine.rc, contrib/Mush.rc: Bring the sample rc
	files better in synch with the actual code.

	* recvattach.c: Remove a warning which comes from code
	actually belonging to the send_charset patch.

	* rfc2047.c: Encode- and decode the "val" field when using
	mutt with EXACT_ADDRESS enabled.

	* charsets/Makefile.in, Makefile.am: Small fixes to the
	build process. From Lars Hecking.

	* compose.c: The attached patch fixes yet another redraw
	related bug. When I call OP_SAVE from the Compose menu and
	use the file-browser and 'q' out of the file-browser, the
	screen still shows the browser, but the control is really in
	the Compose menu. A Ctrl-L verifies this. Basically, a
	screen redraw is missing. (From Vikas.)

	* mutt_menu.h, menu.c, compose.c: From the Compose menu,
	invoke attach-message. Tag a whole bunch of messages. Say,
	for example, 100. When you exit the folder, the Compose
	menu's status line has disappeared. (From Vikas.)

	* browser.c: patch-0.94.17.vikas.browser_redraw.1

Mon Nov 23 21:10:12 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* protos.h, lib.c:
	Change safe_malloc's size parameter from (unsigned int) to size_t.

	* send.c, protos.h, pattern.c, alias.c: From Byrial:

	I don't think that the match-all pattern modifier works as can be
	expected from a logical point of view.

	The attached patch will make it work as I expect it to work:

	  - It works on all patterns which explicit or implicit use address
	    lists: ~c, ~C, ~e, ~f, ~l, ~L, ~p, ~P, and ~t. (It didn't work
	    with ~l before).

	  - It works such that a modified pattern always match, unless there
	    is at least one address in at least one of the referenced lists
	    that it doesn't match.

	* doc/manual.sgml.in, send.c, mutt.h, mh.c, init.h, Muttrc.in:
	Introduce a new option $reply_self.  From Vikas.

Fri Nov 20 00:27:03 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* po/it.po: New it.po from Mario.

	* doc/mutt.man.in: Fix a small typo.

Thu Nov 19 23:57:03 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* po/uk.po, po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/es.po, po/de.po, send.c:
	Hack around problems with multi-valued Reply-To headers.  From
	Roland Rosenfeld.

	* rfc2047.c:
	Properly encode '_' characters in words which are qp-encoded.

	* sendlib.c:
	Use mutt_is_message_type() in the message transformation code.

	* po/Makefile.in.in, doc/Makefile.in, charsets/Makefile.in, Makefile.am:
	Fix all Makefiles.  make DESTDIR=/path/to/something install should
	work now.

Wed Nov 18 23:09:46 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* po/uk.po, po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/es.po, po/de.po, reldate.h, VERSION, ChangeLog:
	Release-commit for 0.94.17.

	* sendlib.c, protos.h, pgp.c, parse.c, lib.c, compose.c:
	This patch simplifies the generation of content type parameters
	significantly by introducing a funciton mutt_set_parameter().
	Additionally, we re-use code from parse.c for parsing user-input
	content type headers on the compose screen.

	* compose.c: Remove some uuencode-related debris.

	* recvattach.c:
	Remove some code which crept in from the external character set patch.

	* recvattach.c:
	Make optional formats work while processing $attach_format.

Wed Nov 18 22:57:03 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* sendlib.c, protos.h, pgp.c, parse.c, lib.c, compose.c:
	This patch simplifies the generation of content type parameters
	significantly by introducing a funciton mutt_set_parameter().
	Additionally, we re-use code from parse.c for parsing user-input
	content type headers on the compose screen.

	* compose.c: Remove some uuencode-related debris.

	* recvattach.c:
	Remove some code which crept in from the external character set patch.

	* recvattach.c:
	Make optional formats work while processing $attach_format.

	* mh.c: Remove bogus re-sorting code from the maildir check routine.

	* mutt.h:
	Include <unistd.h>, so SEEK_SET is defined on some systems which
	don't do so in <stdlib.h>.

Tue Nov 17 13:23:26 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* po/uk.po, po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/es.po:
	Checkpoint commit, containing quite a few fuzzy translations.

	* po/de.po: Update some messages.

	* m4/Makefile.am.in, m4/README, m4/gettext.m4, m4/lcmessage.m4, m4/progtest.m4, prepare, configure.in, Makefile.am:
	Configuration fixes from Lars Hecking, with some more fixes and
	modifications from myself.  With some luck, you don't need a gettext
	installation any more.

	* sendlib.c:
	Fix the base64 encoder.  The current code would produce slightly
	unpredictible output which leads to bad signatures.

	* postpone.c, pgp.c, parse.c, pager.c:
	Fix a search coloring related bug.

Mon Nov 16 11:44:42 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* protos.h: Drop ci_attach - it doesn't exist.  Noted by Byrial Jensen.

Sun Nov 15 09:53:23 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* parse.c: Stupid typo.

	* protos.h, parse.c, attach.c: My version of Byrial's parse_part patch.

	* recvattach.c, protos.h, mutt.h, copy.c, compose.c:
	I can elaborate a little more on the last paragraph. It is deletion
	of the top level part direct under a message/rfc822 part which
	gives problems because the headers of the message/rfc822 part have
	to be changed in this case. It is hard to tell exactly how many
	bytes and lines will be removed and added in this case.

	If we can refrain from deletion of such parts and thus only allow
	deletion of parts direct under a multipart part, then it is
	relative easy always to make correct Content-Length: and Lines:
	headers in the copy. (The correctness of the Lines count is
	dependent of the correctness of the initial value, though).

	(From: Byrial Jensen)

	* doc/manual.sgml.in:
	Correcting Vikas' E-Mail address in the credits section.

Sat Nov 14 08:24:56 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* doc/manual.sgml.in: Update Byrial's e-mail address.

	* copy.c:
	Simplify the new attachment deletion code not to require an extra
	temporary file.  (From: Byrial Jensen <byrial@image.dk>)

	* help.c, handler.c: Type cast nit from Gero Treuner.

Fri Nov 13 18:31:06 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* imap.c:
	Currently, Mutt won't use a default folder if just the IMAP server is
	specified.  In fact, if the folder isn't specified, it will core-dump.

	The attached patch will use INBOX as the IMAP folder name if none is
	specified, eliminating the core-dump.

	(From: Aaron Schrab <aaron+mutt@schrab.com>)

Thu Nov 12 21:52:01 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* mutt.h, copy.c: Byrial's latest attachment deletion patch.

	* po/it.po: New it.po from Marco.

	* snprintf.c: Don't use the mutt_str* functions in this module.

	* strcasecmp.c:
	the s/str.*cmp/mutt_str.*cmp/ replacement should not have taken
	place here.

Tue Nov 10 22:21:51 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* dotlock.c: Don't use mutt_strsomething in the dotlocking code.

	* send.c: Fix the $metoo option's behaviour.

	* thread.c, strcasecmp.c, status.c, sort.c, socket.c,
	snprintf.c, sendlib.c, send.c, score.c, rfc822.c, rfc2047.c,
	rfc1524.c, recvattach.c, query.c, protos.h, postpone.c,

	commands.c, color.c, charset.c, buffy.c, browser.c,
	attach.c, alias.c, addrbook.c: Introduce or rewrite
	mutt_{str*cmp,strlen} and use them all over the place.  If
	there are still segmentation faults due to missing NONULLs
	over, they are gone now.

	* main.c: Add a "pseudo-credit" to the extended copyright notice.

	* po/uk.po, po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/es.po, po/de.po, reldate.h, VERSION, ChangeLog:
	Releasing 0.94.16.

	* sendlib.c, mx.h, mx.c, mbox.c, init.c, copy.c, commands.c, buffy.c, attach.c:
	Experimental support for the so-called "kendra" mail folder format.
	This seems to be used on OS/2 and is, actually, a slibhtly modified
	version of the MMDF format.

	* parse.c:
	Do some sanity checking when reading attachment.  This fix should
	catch bad attachments.

	* edit.c:
	Fix a possible buffer overflow.  (This seems to be the one noticed
	by Pavel Gulchouck <gul@lucky.net>.)

	* compose.c: Wrong fix from Vikas.  Undo it.  (Noted by Byrial.)

Tue Nov 10 21:02:27 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* curs_lib.c, compose.c: Fix a multi_choice related bug.  From Vikas.

	* buffy.c:
	Skip empty mailbox parameters.  This fixes a segmentation fault
	noted by Marco d'Itri.

Mon Nov  9 19:28:42 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* from.c: Catch possible bad memory access.

	* doc/manual.sgml.in, sendlib.c, protos.h, init.h, globals.h, copy.c, Muttrc.in:
	Rewrite copy_delete_attach().

	* sort.c, score.c, protos.h, curs_main.c, color.c:
	Fix an efficiency problem with the color index features.

	* doc/mutt.man.in: Replace @sharedir@ by @sysconfdir@.

	* doc/manual.sgml.in:
	Make the default_hook documentation match the code.

	* main.c, curs_main.c:
	Avoid duplicate mx_close_mailbox() when OP_QUIT is called.

	* browser.c:
	The attached patch fixes a potential problem in folder_format_str()
	where a fixed buffer might not be null terminated.  From Vikas.

	* init.c:
	The attached patch fixes a bug in :set variable=<TAB> where variables
	of type DT_SORT were not getting expanded (only 4 of them, but a bug
	nevertheless).  From Vikas.

	* browser.c: patch-0.94.15.vikas.browser_sort.3

	* parse.c, handler.c:
	A message/external-body handler.  From Byrial Jensen.

	* protos.h, parse.c:
	 - remove the static declaration from parse_date() in parse.c,

	 - fix a minor bug: the timezone information in an expires-header
	   was used to set the timezone of the send time.

	(From Byrial Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>.)

	* Muttrc.in: Fix some spelling errors noted by Boris Wesslowski
	<Boris.Wesslowski@StudBox.Uni-Stuttgart.DE>.

	* handler.c:
	Byrial Jensen's alternative_handler patches.  This may lead to
	non-desirable effects with attachment deletion; these effects will
	go when the new attachment deletion code is implemented.

	* parse.c:
	SeokChan LEE <bofh@nuri.net> says KST has a nine hour offset from GMT.

	* pager.c, help.c: Fix the display of DEL in the pager.

	* send.c: Fix a group reply problem.

Fri Oct 30 13:00:10 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* po/uk.po, po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/es.po, po/de.po:
	Some recent changes.

Thu Oct 29 09:46:45 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* mbox.c:
	Mbox robustness patch from Johnny Tevessen <j.tevessen@gmx.net>.

	* po/de.po: Fixing a typo.

	* imap.c:
	This patch should cause mutt to ask for your IMAP login/password

	pre-release commit, take 1.

	* curs_lib.c:
	Add an IsPrint check to mutt_message() and mutt_curses_error(). This
	will prevent _some_ advert effects from l10ns which don't fit
	together with the terminal's abilities.  There are still quite a few
	raw printw() etc. - we may wish to introduce our own, locale-safe
	versions of these.

	* po/POTFILES.in: reldate contais really _no_ i18n-related data.

	* send.c:
	Don't try to recall a postponed message when we are given a template.

	* copy.c:
	Fix a possible segmentation fault when deleting nested attachments.

	* copy.c:
	Fix a possible segmentation fault when deleting nested attachments.

	* doc/manual.sgml.in, send.c, mutt.h, init.h:
	Add a $forward_weed option which controls header weeding when
	decode-forwarding messages.

	* po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/es.po, po/de.po:
	German translation fixes from Gero plus checkpoint commit.

	* doc/manual.sgml.in, pager.h, pager.c, mutt_menu.h, keymap.c, help.c, curs_main.c, commands.c, attach.c, OPS:
	Gero Treuner's help-wrap patch.

	* po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/es.po, po/de.po:
	Adding a current spanish translation.

	* send.c:
	if reply-to points to the address on the from header, use the from
	header's value for composing a reply's recipient list, not the
	reply-to header.

	* configure.in: add the ukrainian l10n.

Tue Oct 27 19:02:45 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* Attic/configure:
	Configure is generated automatically and should thus _not_ be part
	of the CVS repository.

	* configure.in, Attic/configure, README, INSTALL:
	Try to detect Solaris 2.4's broken regcomp().

	* send.c: Move some code around.

	* doc/manual.sgml.in: Some documentation nits.

	* dotlock.c:
	include config.h _before_ checking for HAVE_GETOPT.  Noted by Scott
	Perlman <perlman@linguist.dartmouth.edu>.

	* Muttrc.in: Add a macro for viewing the manual.

	* pgp.c, configure.in, Attic/configure: i18n fixes.

	* po/ru.po, po/es.po, po/it.po, po/de.po:
	A couple of i18n fixes, plus a partial spanish translation from
	Boris Wesslowski <Boris.Wesslowski@StudBox.Uni-Stuttgart.DE>.

	* configure.in, Attic/configure:
	Handle systems which have neither pgp2 nor pgp5, but gpg correctly.

	* compose.c: - snd_entry() is marked static
	- You will only get a full redraw of the screen after invoking
	  pgp_send_menu if you selected "sign as".
	- draw_envelope() and edit_address_list() use the same array of
	  strings for titles/prompts. This saves both string data and code
	  in both functions which have been a lot smaller.

	* sendlib.c, send.c, protos.h, postpone.c, compose.c:
	Preserve FCC headers when postponing.  From Vikas.

	* mx.c, mutt.h, imap.c:
	Prevent mutt from re-reading IMAP folders before quitting.

Thu Oct 22 13:53:47 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* send.c: Undo some superfluous changes.  Pointed out by V.A.

	* send.c, protos.h, postpone.c:
	- Preserve certain headers' values when recallling a postponed
	  message.  TBD:  Fcc.

	- Rename mutt_edit_message() to mutt_prepare_edit_message() since
	  that's what that function actually does.

	* mx.h, mx.c, lib.c, flags.c:
	Make _all_ IMAP-related code conditionally defined.  From Byrial
	Jensen.

Wed Oct 21 22:46:16 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* protos.h, pattern.c, hdrline.c:
	Fix match-all for the ~p, ~P modifiers.

	* compose.c: Vikas' write_fcc patch.

	* doc/manual.sgml.in: Documentation nits from Byrial.

	* curs_lib.c:

	* doc/devel-notes.txt:
	Add a gettext automake macro patch which is needed for proper
	building of mutt.

	* prepare, Attic/config.h.in, Attic/aclocal.m4, README, INSTALL:
	Remove some automatically generated files from the CVS repository,
	and add a script which generates them.

	Don't hard-wire the program's version in configure.in, but use the
	VERSION file instead.  Stolen from gnupg.

	* ChangeLog: Checkpoint commit.

	* doc/manual.sgml.in, keymap.c, functions.h, NEWS:
	Another macro-function fix from Vikas.

Tue Oct 20 22:02:58 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* po/ru.po, po/it.po, po/de.po: Checkpoint commit.

	* config.h.in, Makefile.am: Include VERSION with the distribution.

	* recvattach.c, query.c, postpone.c, pgpkey.c, curs_main.c,
	compose.c, browser.c, addrbook.c: The attached patch removes
	some redundant code related to the macro function stuff.
	Since each menu calls km_dokey() to get the 'op' number to
	execute, the 'menu' argument to km_dokey() _is_ the
	CurrentMenu. Hence, there is no need to explicitly
	save/restore the CurrentMenu all over the code. The only
	places it is being captured now is just before
	mutt_enter_comamnd() is called. This is to help the 'exec'
	command completion code so that it knows which menu to try
	and complete the function name from. (From: Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>)

	* keymap.c, curs_lib.c: Fix macro functions for the pager menu.

	* keymap.c:
	The attached patch fixes a minor inconsistency between the display
	of special key-names in the help screen and their actual usage. The
	help screen now shows the special keys exactly as you
	would/could/should use them in the muttrc/command-line. (From: Vikas
	Agnihotri <VikasA@att.com>)

	* keymap.c: Fix the error message for unbound keys.  From Vikas.

	where they didnt respect the given prefix. In addition, the manual
	says that %B is supposed to fall back to %b if the message is not
	sent to a known mailing list. The code was not doing that.  (From:
	Vikas Agnihotri <VikasA@att.com>, noted on comp.mail.mutt by
	unny@rz114s0.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de (Vladimir Klebanov)).

	* doc/PGP-Notes.txt:

	* pager.c: A new quote_levels patch from liviu.

	* sendlib.c:
	Rewrite the base64-encoder used for messages.  This should be
	unified with the encoder in rfc2047.c at some point.

	* sendlib.c, mutt.h, charset.h, charset.c:
	[patch-0.94.7i.gt.charset-send.1.gz] With the new charset support in
	mutt there are better chances to say whether a mail to send consists
	of characters of the ASCII set only (the charset should be
	"us-ascii" then) or of other characters from the given charset (this
	charset should be given then): ASCII characters have the unicode
	values from 0 to 127.

	* mh.c: Correct the index_hint handling in mh_check_mailbox().

	* sendlib.c: RFC2047-encode the mail-followup-to header.

	* TODO: Remove the maildir/mh resynch entry.

	* pager.c:
	There is a long-standing problem in Mutt, related to coloring the
	various levels of quoting: if the attributions are missing, like
	this:
	        >>> blah blah from A
		>> blah blah from B
		> blah blah from C

	then the "quoted" color object is associated with ">>>", "quoted1"
	with ">>" and "quoted2" with ">" --- which is not what most people
	expect. The reason is Mutt doesn't count the quote characters (since
	there is no way to distinguish between a single quote ">> " and a
	">" followed by a "> "), and it allocates colors as it finds new
	types of quote prefixes. The attached patch fixes this problem still
	without counting the quote characters.

Tue Sep 22 22:54:52 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* mx.h, mx.c, mutt.h, mh.c, mbox.c, buffy.c:

	* mx.c: When generating new messages in MH folders, the initial number
	should be "1", not "2".  Fix from Gero Treuner.

Wed Sep 16 20:08:25 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* curs_lib.c:
	Attached is a minor fix to mutt_getch in curs_lib.c - as of 0.93.2i,
	if +'metakey' and 'timeout' were both set, mutt_getch was returning
	an ESC rather than -1, which resulted in 'key not bound' messages
	every 'timeout' seconds.  (From: Tim Walberg <walberg@cig.mot.com>)

	* copy.c:
	[patch-0.94.6i.oe.dprint2.1] Fix a segmentation fault when running
	in -d2 mode.

	* keymap.c: Use <fN> for function keys as well as for other special
	keys.  Additionally, this patch makes it possible to use
	all special keys inside a key _sequence_.

	* sendlib.c, mutt.h, curs_main.c, compose.c:
	Introduce the OPTUSEHEADERDATE pseudo-option to control
	mutt_write_rfc822_header()'s behaviour for the purposes of
	the edit_message feature.

	* init.c: When parsing aliases, don't consider ';' a token
	delimiter.

	* rfc2047.c, charset.c, charset.h, handler.c, Makefile.in:
	[patch-0.93.2i.ru.mmultiple_charsets.gz] This patch adds
	support for international character sets.  Currently, mutt
	knows about the following character sets and is able to
	convert between them:

	iso-8859-1, ..., iso-8859-9, koi8-r, windows-1251, x-cp866.

	* recvattach.c, protos.h, pattern.c, mutt.h,
	init.c, history.h, enter.c, commands.c: When

	works only for variables of type 'string'.

	Also fixes the following buglets in command-completion:

	 1. doesnt work if you started the command-line with
	 whitespace

	 2. Seems to think that 'Set', 'ReSeT', etc are valid

	* TODO: Bogus bug.  Actually, by setting use_mailcap=no, it _is_
	possible to view the header of a single-part message with
	a non-autoview body type.

	* recvattach.c: This patch makes the view attachment menu show all
	message/rfc822 parts as a new level, not only the
	multipart messages. This makes it possible to display a
	message/rfc822 part which includes only a image/jpeg part
	or something else which cant be viewed in the pager.

Wed Aug 26 21:12:23 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc822.c: Another possible memory leak in
	rfc822_parse_adrlist.  The problem and the patch
	are pretty much the same as with the last fix
	applied to this file - it's just ',' instaed of
	';' this time.

	* rfc822.c, TODO:
	[patch-0.94.4i.tlr.rfc822_leak.1] Fixing a memory leak in
	the rfc822_parse_adrlist().

	Some explanations seem to be in order here.  Let's look at
	the code:

	   386	    else if (*s == ';')
	   387	    {
	   388	      if (phraselen)
	   389	      {
	   390		phrase[phraselen] = 0;
	   391		add_addrspec (&top, &last, phrase, comment, &commentlen, sizeof (comment) - 1);
	   392	      }
	   393	      else if (commentlen && !last->personal)
	   394	      {
	   395		comment[commentlen] = 0;
	   396		last->personal = safe_strdup (comment);
	   397	      }
	   398	#ifdef EXACT_ADDRESS
	   399	      if (last && !last->val)

	Line 399 contains the change; previously, it looked like
	this:

	   399'       if (last)

	   400		last->val = mutt_substrdup (begin, s);
	   401	#endif
	   402
	   403	      /* add group terminator */
	   404	      cur = rfc822_new_address ();
	   405	      if (last)
	   406	      {
	   407		last->next = cur;
	   408		last = cur;
	   409	      }
	   410
	   411	      phraselen = 0;
	   412	      commentlen = 0;
	   413	      s++;
	   414	      begin = s;
	   415	      SKIPWS (begin);
	   416	    }

	OK, what happens? There are essentially two situations here:

	-> We have already parsed a complete address specification
	   and know about this fact, but there was no new address
	   information.  This is the case if we are parsing
	   through addresses like

		undisclosed-recipients:;

	   or

		recipients: a, b, c,;

	   (Note the extra ',' before the ';'!)

	   In this case, some of the other code in rfc822.c has
	   already filled in last->val, and we really shouldn't
	   overwrite that with a NULL pointer.

	-> The ';' finishes an address spec, like in

		recipients: a;

	   In this case, last is either set by add_addrspec(), or
	   it has already been set by some of the previous code
	   (comment handling, ...).  Anyway, last->val is still
	   NULL, so it is correct to write the complete addr spec
	   to last->val.

	* imap.c: Error message cosmetics.

	* curs_main.c: [patch-0.94.4i.tlr.synch_fault.1]
	Start up two mutts. Delete the last message in
	both of them.  Synchronize the mailbox in both of
	them. Segmentation fault.

	* TODO: adding a few notes.

	* commands.c: If you issue "decode-save" on an
	encrypted message without reading it first, Mutt
	won't prompt you for a passphrase, and it will
	happily write an empty message, deleting the
	original.  (From an unnamed colleague of Liviu
	Daia.)

	* imap.c: [patch-0.94.4i.tlr.imap_newline.2] Use
	cr nl instead of single nl when uploading a
	message to an imap server.

	* sendlib.c, protos.h, postpone.c, compose.c:
	[patch-0.94.4i.tlr.encoding.1] Fix
	content-transfer-encoding updates when renaming
	files from the compose menu and when recalling
	postponed messages.

	* imap.c: s/free/FREE/

	* TODO, Attic/BUGS: Compile BUGS and TODO into a
	comprehensive issue list.

	* Attic/BUGS: Clean up the bug list.

	* reldate.h, configure.in, configure, ChangeLog:
	0.94.4i.

	* doc/manual.txt, doc/manual.sgml: Documenting
	$hidden_host.

	* thread.c, curs_main.c: Fix "previous-subthread"
	in reverse-threads mode, allow next-(sub)thread
	and previous-(sub)thread to work in limited mode.
	(From: Liviu Daia)

	* doc/manual.txt, doc/manual.sgml: Documenting $hidden_host.

	* thread.c, curs_main.c: Fix "previous-subthread"
	in reverse-threads mode, allow next-(sub)thread
	and previous-(sub)thread to work in limited mode.
	(From: Liviu Daia)

Sun Aug 23 10:05:41 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* sendlib.c, send.c, protos.h, mutt.h, main.c,
	init.h, init.c, configure.in, configure,
	config.h.in, alias.c, acconfig.h, INSTALL:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.hidden_host.1] Replace the
	--enable-hidden-host configure switch by a
	configuration variable $hidden_host which can be
	changed at run-time. This variable will _not_
	affect the generation of message-IDs since we'll
	get into uniqueness problems if we just use the
	domain here.

	Needs to be documented.

	* doc/manual.txt: Committing the latest manual
	changes.

	* Attic/socket.c, imap.c:
	[patch-0.94.3.bl.imap_buffy.1-2] Fixing the
	buffered read stuff.

	* Attic/mutt_socket.h: Ups, this one was missing
	from Brandon's IMAP patch.

Sat Aug 22 14:24:18 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* help.c: [patch-0.94.3i.gt.beautify_help.1.gz]
	General help beautification.  From Gero Treuner.

	* doc/manual.sgml, keymap.h, keymap.c, help.c,
	Muttrc.in: [patch-0.94.3i.gt.description.1]
	Introduce macro descriptions.

	* doc/manual.sgml, init.h, init.c, browser.c: Add
	a negation operator "!" to $mask's syntax (as in
	the *-hooks).  From Liviu.

	* recvattach.c: Make Vikas' attach_split and
	Brandon's other_type patches fit together.

	* recvattach.c, mutt.h, init.h, globals.h,
	compose.c: [patch-0.94.3.vikas.attach_split.3]
	Re-introduce attach_split.

	* Attic/socket.c: [patch-0.94.3.bl.imap_buffy.1]
	Adding Brandon's IMAP buffy support.

	* mx.c, mutt.h, mailbox.h, imap.h, imap.c,
	curs_lib.c, configure.in, configure, buffy.c,
	browser.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3.bl.imap_buffy.1] Adding Brandon's
	IMAP buffy support.

Fri Aug 21 08:17:09 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* browser.c: Enter the file browser, type a mask
	which doesn't match any file in the current
	directory, clean the mask. Segfault.  Fix from
	Liviu Daia.

Thu Aug 20 22:32:46 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* sendlib.c, recvattach.c, parse.c, mutt.h,
	mime.h, lib.c, handler.c, globals.h, compose.c,
	commands.c, attach.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3.bl.other_types.1] This patch adds
	support for the model MIME type.  Additionally,
	along the lines of "strict in what you generate,
	accepting in what you receive", this patch will
	keep the name of major mime types it doesn't
	recognize (instead of using x-unknown).

	* compose.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3i.jmy.attachmessage-fix.1] This patch
	fixes a bug in the allocation of space for new
	pointers to the attachments, it would make mutt
	seg-fault when attaching 5 or more messages at the
	same time. (From: Jimmy Mäkelä
	<jmy@flashback.net>)

	* handler.c: [SECURITY] mutt_sanitize_filename()
	should be called when creating temporary files for
	autoview.  (From: Liviu Daia.)

	* sendlib.c, send.c, attach.c: Try this: set
	$mime_forward, forward a PGP-encrypted message,
	then in the "compose" menu try to view the
	forwarded message. If you didn't enter a
	passphrase before, Mutt won't ask for it either.
	(From: Liviu Daia)

	* sendlib.c, attach.c: When you forward a message
	with $mime_forward set, or when you attach a
	message with the "attach-message" command from the
	"compose" menu, there is a memory leak.  The real
	reason for this leak is that multipart attachments
	are not supported in the "compose" menu, so you
	need to go through quite a few contortions in
	order to handle message/rfc822 attachments.
	Consequently, the patch below is just an ugly
	hack.  (From: Liviu Daia)

Sun Aug 16 06:22:51 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc822.c: Bringing 128-byte strings to "STRING".

	* sendlib.c: Use add_option, not add_arg, for
	strings such as "--".

	* sendlib.c: Pass an "--" argument to sendmail
	before the address arguments, so addresses with a
	leading dash don't lead to problems. (From Liviu.)

	* sendlib.c, rfc822.c, rfc1524.c, parse.c, mx.c,
	main.c, lib.c, keymap.c, hash.c, handler.c,
	edit.c, curs_lib.c, alias.c: Replacing a bunch of
	free() and malloc() calls by safe_free() and
	safe_malloc().  (From Liviu.)

Sat Aug 15 18:27:45 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* imap.c: read() can't read buffers larger than
	SSIZE_MAX.

	* hook.c: [patch-0.94.3i.tlr.empty_hook.1] Ignore
	empty hooks instead of segfaulting.

	* protos.h, init.c, Attic/history.h:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.history.1] Adding history class
	support.

	* Attic/history.c: [patch-0.94.3i.tlr.history.1]
	Adding history class support.

	* enter.c, TODO, Makefile.in:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.history.1] Adding history class
	support.

	* sendlib.c:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.attach_msg_fmt.1-2] When
	generating a message/rfc822 type attachment, parse
	its header so that the attachment format routines
	can properly display the default description.

	* init.h: Change attach_format's default to limit
	the attachment description's length.

Thu Aug 13 22:09:16 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* pgppubring.c: Fixing another memory leak in the
	pubring parser.

	* recvattach.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.attach_msg_fmt.1] When parsing
	the "%d" format option in the attachment format,
	use the message format as a fall-back if no
	explicit description is provided.  This fixes the
	following bug:

	  set mime_forward. Forward any mesage. The
	  compose menu will show the description as
	  "Forwarded message from ...." which is fine.
	  Pressing 'd' to edit the description brings up
	  the above string for editing.

	  Now hit Enter on the message/rfc822 attachment
	  to view it. Quit out of the pager.

	  The description field has now changed to the
	  Subject: of the forwarded message. Pressing 'd'
	  still brings up the 'Forwarded message from....'
	  string.

	(Noted by Vikas.)

	* doc/manual.txt, doc/manual.sgml, sendlib.c,
	mutt.h, init.h: [patch-0.94.3i.tlr.write_bcc.1]
	This patch adds an option $write_bcc which
	controls whether the Bcc header is written out or
	not.  This can be used to work around broken MTA's
	(Exim seems to leave Bcc headers in).

	The problem was noted independently by Peter
	Radcliffe <pir@pir.net> and by Dave Holland
	<dave@zenda.demon.co.uk> (Debian Bug #25687).

	* pgppubring.c: [patch-0.94.3i.tlr.pubring_leak.1]
	Fixing a memory leak. Bug noted by Liviu Daia.

	* reldate.h: 0.94.3i.

	* configure.in, configure, ChangeLog: Preparing
	0.94.3i.

	* compose.c: indentation cosmetics.

	* compose.c: Update menu->data when OP_COMPOSE_EDIT_HDRS is called.
	From Vikas.

	* compose.c: Update the encoding after using ispell from the compose
	menu.  From Vikas.

	* sendlib.c, send.c, protos.h, pgppubring.c,
	pattern.c, lib.c, curs_main.c, compose.c,
	attach.c: Various nits from Liviu; encoding fixes.

	* rfc822.c: Fixing a buffer overflow in rfc822_cat().  tmplen could
	underflow.

Wed Aug 12 11:50:59 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* init.c: Yet another memory leak fix from Liviu.

	* rfc2047.c: Fixing a stupid buffer overflow plus some flawed logic.

	* functions.h, compose.c, OPS:
	Adding an update-encoding function to the compose menu.
	This is useful if the user has externally modified an
	attachment and _wants_ to adjust the encoding afterwards.
	Also, this patch fixes some redraw-related problems in the
	compose menu.

	* sendlib.c, mutt.h, compose.c, Attic/BUGS:
	When changing or deleting attachments, the compose menu
	now notices this and complains or asks accordingly.
	Partially from Vikas.

Tue Aug 11 08:14:38 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* Attic/BUGS: Yet another outstanding bug.

	* doc/manual.txt: This now contains the latest changes to manual.sgml.

	* sendlib.c, rfc2047.c, rfc1524.c, pgppubring.c, pager.c, hdrline.c:
	Fixing various nits noted by Liviu and his colleagues.

Mon Aug 10 15:30:02 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* sendlib.c: This patches makes the message-id persistant when
	postponing messages.  (From: Janos Farkas)

	* doc/manual.sgml, sample.muttrc, lib.c, init.h:
	This patch introduces "unhdr_order" to reset the hdr_order
	command's effect.  (From: Janos Farkas)

	* color.c: Drop the free_rx parameter from muitt_free_color_line(),
	as it's always 1.

	* color.c: Adding mutt_free_color_line() and replacing varous
	"manual" free()s of color lines by calls to this function.

	* bind.c: Removing bind.c.  Pointed out by Gero Treuner
	<gero@faveve.uni-stuttgart.de>.

Sun Aug  9 18:43:45 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* color.c: With SLang, init_pair is (void), so we must not check its
	return value.

	* color.c: Restructuring color.c.  This patch fixes the "default"
	problem from 0.94.2i and makes the code more
	comprehensible than that version and more consie than
	0.94.1i.

Sat Aug  8 21:40:12 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc2047.c: Fixing the "=?" detection in rfc2047_encode_string().  Bug
	noted by David Jeske <jeske@home.chat.net>.

	* compose.c: If you press t to add a recipient in the compose menu,
	then press tab, q, and aborts with ctrl-g, mutt won't
	redraw the menu.  Noted by Jimmy Mäkelä
	<jmy@flashback.net>.

	* alias.c: Entering an un-parsable address when creating an alias
	would make mutt segfault.  Noted by brian moore
	<bem@cmc.net>.

	* browser.c: If you press tab in the file-browser to see the inboxes
	and the current row is greater than the inbox-screens
	max-rows then the screen gets garbled.
	(From: Jimmy Mäkelä <jmy@flashback.net>)

	* doc/manual.txt, doc/manual.sgml: I made the manual more up to date:

	* new version
	* new mailing list and home page addresses
	* made the terminology a bit more consistent regarding
	  'pattern' and 'regular expression'
	* added a note about expanding UNIX environments
	* added a note about <, >, in range patterns like ~m
	* added a note about the urlview program
	* changed tables to not use tabs, because it doesn't work
	  right in my favourite web browsers lynx and netscape

	(From: Gero Treuner <gero@faveve.uni-stuttgart.de>)

	* pattern.c: This patch makes pattern ranges more logical. Before '~m
	<5' would show message 1-5, with this patch it shows 1-4.
	Inclusive ranges is still avaible if you use '~m -5'.
	(From: Jimmy Mäkelä <jmy@flashback.net>)

	* init.c: Various improvements to the mutt_command_complete
	function.  From Stephen Hack <shack@rsn.hp.com>.

	* browser.c: If you specify 'mailboxes ""' mutt will seg-fault. (From:
	Jimmy Mäkelä <jmy@flashback.net>)

	* color.c: Fixing a memory leak.  Thanks, Liviu.

	* commands.c: When printing a message, headers are now sorted according
	to hdr_order.  From Liviu.

	* browser.c: Fixing an off-by-one buffer overflow in browser.c.  Noted
	by Liviu.

	* lib.c, attach.c: This patch adds some more "safe" characters to
	mutt_sanitize_filename and fixes its usage in
	mutt_view_attachment().  (From: Liviu Daia
	<daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

	* status.c, sort.h, sendlib.c, send.c, query.c, protos.h, postpone.c, pager.h, pager.c, mutt_menu.h, menu.c, main.c, init.c, headers.c, functions.h, curs_main.c, curs_lib.c, compose.c, commands.c, browser.c, addrbook.c, OPS:
	Adding the attach message patch.  From Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>.

	* Makefile.in: There is no "compile" rule for dotlock in the Makefile.
	(From: Dan Nelson <dnelson@emsphone.com>)

	* imap.c: Thispatch to imap.c allows the user to specify a port
	number in the folder name in the general form
	{hostname:portnum}foldername. (From: Andy Sloane
	<andude@guildsoftware.com>)

	* imap.c: imap_close_connection() was being called even though the
	client was using mulitple mailboxes over the same
	connection.  (From: Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net>)


Fri Jul 31 08:17:50 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc1524.c: Changing an sprintf to an snprintf (which it was meant to
	be.)

	* protos.h: mutt_sanitize_filename takes char *, not const char *.

	* protos.h, lib.c, attach.c:
	Introducing mutt_sanitize_filename().  The code is similar
	to patch-0.91.1i.tlr.rfc1524_sanitize.1 and to Peter
	Holzer's patch against 0.91.

	* rfc1524.h, rfc1524.c, postpone.c, attach.c:
	Avoid possible buffer overflows in mutt_adv_mktemp().

	* sendlib.c: Interpret sysexits-style exit values from sendmail.

	* configure.in, configure, config.h.in, acconfig.h:
	Check for sysexits.h.

Thu Jul 30 09:30:38 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* edit.c: When reading in files, be_snarf_file() wouldn't recognize
	'~' as the user's home directory.

Wed Jul 29 10:54:09 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* README, Changes: Finalizing 0.93.2i.

	* configure.in, configure: Bumping to 0.93.2(i).

	* parse.c: Fixing a buffer overflow in parse.c which presented a
	serious security thread.  Noted by Paul Boehm
	<paul@boehm.org>.

Tue Jul 28 08:21:49 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* Attic/patch.slang-1.2.2.keypad.1: Adding a patch for a SLang bug.

	* INSTALL: Adding a patch for a SLang bug.

	* mx.c: Doing 'mutt -f NoSuchFile' just flickers the screen and
	silently exits. Earlier (0.92.14 at least), it used to
	spit out the error 'NoSuchFile: no such file or directory
	(errno = 2)'.  (Noted and tracked down by Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>)

	* color.c: The index cache should be updated even without color
	support.

Mon Jul 27 13:39:39 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* Attic/BUGS: Adding a notice about some more nits.

	* main.c: Change the error reporting mail address from
	<mutt-dev@cs.hmc.edu> to <mutt-dev@mutt.org>.

	* protos.h, init.h, color.c:
	This patch fixes index "color" patterns when using a
	non-color capable curses library.  While working on color
	support, I've thrown together the mutt_parse_color() and
	mutt_parse_mono() functions as they are sharing most of
	their code.  Additionally, a new directive called "unmono"
	is introduced.  The implementation consists in adding a
	flag and very few lines of code (plus ifdefs) to
	mutt_parse_uncolor().

	* snprintf.c, rfc1524.h, rfc1524.c, date.c:
	Fixing some minor nits: missing #includes in date.c and
	snprintf.c, and a not-so-nice declaration of
	rfc1524_new_entry().  Noted by Digital cc and gcc.

Fri Jul 24 08:12:46 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* copy.c, attach.c:
	Fiddling around with message/rfc822 attachments once again.

Thu Jul 23 20:57:50 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* status.c, sendlib.c, send.c, rfc2047.c, pop.c, pager.c, mx.c, mh.c, mbox.c, lib.c, init.c, imap.c, edit.c, curs_lib.c, compose.c, commands.c, color.c, browser.c, attach.c, alias.c:
	Guard lots of global (char *) variable deferences against
	NULL pointers.

	* copy.c, attach.c:
	Yet another patch about saving message/rfc822 attachments.

	* main.c, send.c: Fixing potential NULL pointer deferences.

Wed Jul 22 22:47:57 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* recvattach.c: Another fix from Liviu.

	* recvattach.c, from.c, attach.c:
	Another patch from liviu to fix the message/rfc822
	behaviour.

	* recvattach.c, mx.c, attach.c:
	This patch fixes the saving of message/rfc822 attachments
	to mail folders.  Additionally, it fixes an outstanding
	bug with From_ lines being written to MH folders.

	(From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

	* menu.c, functions.h, browser.c, OPS:
	1. When I hit 'c' (change dir) in browser, it gives me the
	   directory, but without the final '/', so I have to add
	   '/' to add a subdirectory name. This patch fixes it.

	2. check-new now will recheck mailbox folders for new
	   mail.

	3. added a function toggle-mailboxes which toggles in
	   browser between mailboxes view and directory view.
	   (bound to TAB by default).

	(From: "Michael S. Tsirkin" <mtsirkin@iil.intel.com>)

	* send.c: Correct an error message in send.c.
	(From: Byrial Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>)

	* sendlib.c, recvattach.c, protos.h, postpone.c,
	pager.c, mx.c, mutt.h, lib.c, keymap.c, handler.c,
	compose.c, commands.c, attach.h, attach.c:

	These changes fix some of the bugs which were
	recently reported to mutt-dev.  To be more specific,
	message-type attachments are saved to mail folders
	from the receive attachment menu, some of the
	sending code has been made more robust against
	disappearing attachments, and "tag" is rebound to
	"T" on the compose menu.

	(Some part of this patch comes from Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>.)

	* send.c: Avoid a potential segmentation fault when
	trying to postpone, but Postponed equals NULL.

	* Attic/BUGS: This file is intended to contain known
	bugs which still have to be fixed.

	* doc/manual.txt:
	Committing the changes previously made to manual.sgml.

	* imap.c: Include Message-ID and Reply-To headers
	when fetching a message's headers from an IMAP
	server. (From: Andy Sloane <andude@incarnate.net>)

Tue Jul 21 07:54:03 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* recvattach.c:
	The old behaviour of the %d (for description) specifier is
	recreated by this patch.
	(From: Byrial Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>)

	* protos.h, lib.c, attach.c:
	You should never _ever_ do something like this:

	       [process A]  ---[piped write until EOF]---> [process B]
	       [process A]  <---[piped read until EOF]--- [process B]

	Basically, what happens is something like this: A
	feeds data to B; B processes the data, and feeds it
	to the pipe until the pipe buffer is full; at this
	point, A writes to its pipe until its buffer is full
	too, and if it still has more data to write, that's
	it, it never gets to the read part to flush B's
	buffer --- both processes are blocked on write.

	This patch fixes such a situation in the compose menu.

	(From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

Mon Jul 20 21:01:05 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* reap.pl: Perl lies in /usr/bin on my machines.

	* pop.c: It seems that if you don't enter any
	password at all when prompted for the POP password,
	Mutt will die with a segmentation fault also. (Bug
	reported by Steve Mayer <smayer@rtd.com> via the
	Debian bug tracking system, fix from Thomas
	Roessler.)

	* postpone.c: When you send a message which have
	been postponed before sending, then all its
	attachments (if there are more than one) will have a
	content-disposition header which includes a
	filename, even if there isn't a real filename but
	only random choosen temporary one. (From: Byrial
	Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>)

Sat Jul 18 09:18:31 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* recvattach.c: "Set mime_forward, and forward a
	message --- Mutt will segfault." The obvious fix for
	this is to check for aptr->content->hdr in
	mutt_attach_fmt() before invoking
	_mutt_make_string().  Anyway, I suspect that the
	real fix may involve something like parsing the
	rfc822 attachment in question.

	* sendlib.c: Postponing messages behaves funny when the $postponed
	folder is in Maildir format; I traced this down to the
	fact that postponed messages are saved in "cur" while
	mutt_num_postponed() is looking at "new".
	(From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

	* compose.c: Removing the old snd_entry() code.

	* doc/manual.sgml, protos.h, pgp.c, mutt.h, init.h, hook.c:
	When sending encrypted messages, it may arrive that Mutt
	can't determine the PGP key of the recipient (presumably
	because her address has changed, but she hasn't updated
	her PGP key yet). In this situation it's convenient to be
	able to associate a keyID with an address automatically.
	The attached patch is an attempt to implement this idea
	using a "pgp-hook". (From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>).

	* recvattach.c: Removing the old attach_entry() code.

	* recvattach.c, protos.h, mutt.h, init.h, globals.h, compose.c:
	This patch adds a string variable $attach_format which
	controls the look of the compose and attach menus.
	Unfortunately, I was not able to make things so that it
	would look exactly the same as the hardcoded versions, so
	the default format is a bit different, but I think it is
	quite usable.  (From Michael Elkins <me@cs.hmc.edu>).

	* functions.h, browser.c, OPS:
	This patch allows you to view files from the browser
	window, useful if you are searching for a file to attach
	to your message. It uses the standard mailcap stuff (and
	the lookup mime types) to use the correct "viewer" for the
	file.  (From Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net>)

	* doc/Attic/dotlock.man.in, doc/Makefile.in, configure.in, configure, Makefile.in:
	Dotlock-related changes: We call it mutt.dotlock to avoid
	conflicts with certain NFS versions' dotlocking utilities
	(pointed out by Liviu Daia).  Additionally, we need to
	compile it as an external utility on systems which don't
	have an fchdir(2) system call.

Thu Jul 16 16:39:53 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* mx.c: Fixing a small typographic error.

	* mx.c: Mutt doesn't retry locking if it doesn't succeed at once.
	The code in mx_lock_file is supposed to retry but it
	doesn't work because of a mistake in operator precedence.
	(From: Petri Kaukasoina <kaukasoi@elektroni.ee.tut.fi>)

	* Attic/dotlock.c:
	The dotlock.c file tries to include <posix1_lim.h> if
	_POSIX_PATH_MAX isn't defined but it doesn't include
	<limits.h>, where this symbol should be defined.  (From
	Marc.Baudoin@solsoft.com)

	* send.c: When several messages are tagged and the user applies
	reply, group-reply, or list-reply to these messages, the
	reply's references and in-reply-to headers are constructed
	from the tagged message which comes last in the current
	index.  This patch constructs the references header from
	_all_ messages' message-id and references headers. (tlr)

	* reldate.h, configure.in, configure, Changes, ChangeLog:
	Preparing mutt 0.94.

	* imap.c: "My two remaining issues are the speed at which it
	downloads the headers, and support of PREAUTH. I'm
	enclosing a patch (to stock mutt-0.92.13i) which addresses
	these issues." (From Brian Marcotte
	<marcotte@panix7.panix.com>)

	* color.c: This patch fixes two problems reported on mutt-users.

	(1) the error message about "default colors not supported"
	when not using a color xterm should not be printed.  The
	existing code did not check the value of has_colors() in
	conjunction with use_default_colors()

	(2) mutt would crash when sending mail in batch mode
	because use_default_colors() could be used without doing
	an initscr()

	(From Michael Elkins.)

Wed Jul 15 17:15:46 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* mx.h, mx.c, main.c, Attic/dotlock.h,
	Attic/dotlock.c, configure.in, configure,
	Makefile.in: Finalizing the external dotlock
	support: If group mail privileges are needed, the
	dotlock is compiled as a separate program.  If
	there is no need for privileges, it remains a
	module which is compiled into mutt. Also, there is
	no more need for the SLang buffer overflow
	work-around in main().  We drop it, but let mutt
	bail out instead if it's installed setgid
	something.

	* doc/Attic/dotlock.man.in, Attic/dotlock.c:
	Fix the race condition in dotlock.c.

	* doc/Attic/mutt.man.in:

	* reldate.h, configure.in, configure, Changes, ChangeLog:
	Preparing mutt 0.93.1i.

	* rfc2047.c, mime.h, handler.c: More unsigned fixes.

	* pattern.c, parse.c:

Mon Jul 13 10:50:39 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* doc/mutt.sgml, doc/mutt.man, doc/Makefile.in:
	Since manual page generation seems to be broken in the
	SGML-tools package, we remove the SGML version of mutt.man
	and make the troff source the master copy.  Suggested by
	Roland Rosenfeld <roland@luv.rhein.de> who also provided
	the corrected mutt.man file.

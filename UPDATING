  !: modified feature, -: deleted feature, +: new feature

1.7.0 (2016-08-18):

  ! Improved alignment when using multi-column characters with
    soft-fill (%*X) and right-justified (%>X) format strings.
  + The COLUMNS environment variable will be set to the width of the
    pager when invoking display filters.  This can be used in
    copiousoutput mailcap entries to allow their output to match the
    pager width.
  + The sidebar patch has been merged.  Please watch for airborne
    bovine.  See the documentation for all the options, or simply
    enable it with 'set sidebar_visible'.
  + $mail_check_stats and $mail_check_stats_interval control whether,
    and how often, to scan for unread, flagged, and total message
    counts when checking for new mail in mailboxes.  These statistics
    can be displayed in the sidebar and browser.
  + $trash, when set, specifies the path of the folder where mails
    marked for deletion will be moved, instead of being irremediably
    purged.
  + The <purge-message> function can be used to delete an entry and
    bypass the trash folder.
  + $folder_format has new format strings %m and %n, to display
    total and unread message counts for mailboxes.  Note that
    $mail_check_stats should be enabled to use these.
  ! When browsing IMAP, %N will now display 'N', instead of the unread
    message count.  Please use %n to display unread messages.

1.6.2 (2016-07-06):

  ! Bug fix release.  No features were modified or added.

1.6.1 (2016-05-01):

  + New expandos %r and %R for comma separated list of To: and Cc:
    recipients respectively.
  + Improved support for internationalized email and SMTPUTF8 (RFC653[0-3]).
  ! $use_idn has been renamed to $idn_decode.
  + $idn_encode controls whether outgoing email address domains will
    be IDNA encoded.  If your MTA supports it, unset to use utf-8
    email address domains.
  + The S/MIME message digest algorithm is now specified using the
    option $smime_sign_digest_alg.  Note that $smime_sign_command
    should be modified to include "-md %d".  Please see
    contrib/smime.rc.
  + $reflow_space_quotes allows format=flowed email quotes to be
    displayed with spacing between them.
  ! multipart draft files are now supported.
  + The "-E" command line argument causes mutt to edit draft or include files.
    All changes made in mutt will be saved back out to those files.
  + $resume_draft_files and $resume_edited_draft_files control how
    mutt processes draft files.
  + For classic gpg mode, $pgp_decryption_okay should be set to verify
    multipart/encrypted are actually encrypted.  Please see
    contrib/gpg.rc for the suggested value.
  ! mailto URL header parameters by default are now restricted to
    'body' and 'subject'.
  + mailto_allow and unmailto_allow can be used to add or remove
    allowed mailto header parameters.
  ! The method of setting $hostname has been changed.  Rather than
    scanning /etc/resolv.conf, the domain will now be determined using
    DNS calls.

  ! GnuPG fingerprints are used internally when possible.

    $pgp_list_secring_command to enable this.  Please see contrib/gpg.rc.
    Fingerprints may also be used at the prompts for key selection.
  + $crypt_opportunistic_encrypt automatically enables/disables encryption
    based on message recipients.

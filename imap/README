Mutt's IMAP support is still experimental, in that it hasn't been tested on
a wide variety of servers and machines. It may contain memory leaks, dangling
pointers, and other nasty problems. IWFM. YMMV. Caveant emptor lectorque.

Note in particular that mutt doesn't handle connection timeouts well at all,
and may often crash in their presence. Please keep backups from within your
editor of messages that take a long time to write - the longer you take,
the more likely your connection is to time out, AND the more valuable your
message probably is.

Please report bugs to mutt-dev@mutt.org and/or brendan@kublai.com. Version,
options, stack-trace and .muttdebug files are a plus.

New features vs. the stable distribution:

* Tab-completion of IMAP folder names
* Folder browsing
* Go-fast stripes
* Postponed-message support
* Server-side copy
* Fast sync
* Secure login (GSSAPI and CRAM-MD5)
* More and better segfaults
* Attach messages from IMAP folders
* Use an IMAP path as your Maildir (set folder='')
* Preserve message keywords
* Preserve deleted messages if you don't choose to expunge them
* Delete mailboxes (from the browser)
* Multiple IMAP usernames
